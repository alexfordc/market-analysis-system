I'm including it here because the formatting is changed when it is entered
into the database.)

Standard deviation of a function is not working: Using the agent-based
function with the std. dev. "procedure" (with the basic numeric
command, and other commands that I would expect to work - e.g., BLC)
to calculate an existing function gives the wrong results. Using the
same configuration, except with "no input function" and a closing price
operator gives correct results for std. dev.  of close, so it appears
the std. dev. logic itself is correct. Most likely there is a problem
hooking up the input function as input to the agent-based command.

Note that there is a partial work-around: Use the "function-based command"
and redundantly select the input function for that command. Except for the
first several irrlevant garbage values, the non-garbage records (e.g.,
10th to last) are very close to the reference test values (though not
as close as I would prefer).
