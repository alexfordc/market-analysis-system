Sometimes a "panic" is triggered when the server is doing a market analysis
(i.e., for buy/sell signal generation).  This has happened a few times
with the automated run_market_analysis job for the finance login.  There's
a fair chance that the panic is being caused by running out of memory
due to other piggish processes currently running.

Possible diagnosis steps:

Do a test run of market analysis and see if the server uses significantly
more memory while the analysis runs.

On a day that the panic occurs for the finance login:
Check the top output from the run_market_analysis run to see what processes
were running.  Assuming that some memory hogs were running, try to
simulate the memory state from the top log by, if necessary, starting up
some pig processes.  Then force an analysis for the finance login and see
if the panic reoccors.  If it does, try terminating the pig processes and
run the analysis again and see what happens.  If there is no panic, start
the pig processes again and run aother analysis to verify that this causes
the panic.

Similar to the above procedure, but do it over time - simply make sure that
the "pig" processes are running sometimes for the automated analysis, and
other times not.  After several days, check to see if the panic only
happened when the "pig" processes were running.  If a panic happened when
the memory was fairly free, it's less likely that running out of memory is
the cause of the panic.

Here is some relevant output from the last time this happened.  See the
log file in /home/development/jtc/finance/admin/bug_log for more detailed
info.  (Note: The "Failed to lock event history file ..." message is not
likely to be related to the cause of the panic.  Rather the panic causes
the lock file to not be removed and, as a result, subsequent runs issue
the "failed to lock" message.  I.e., this "failed" message was caused by
a previous panic.)
