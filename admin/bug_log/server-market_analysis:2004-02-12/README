Apparent bug in the mas server that occurs during market analysis

Last night I encountered an apparent bug in the mas server that appears
to occur when doing market analysis ('a' option from macl) when the start
date being used is well before the beginning of the data.  I was running
mas on the machine for Gary Eisen's oneworldhosting account.  I had data
going back about a year and set the start date to now - 5 years.  There
was only one data-set/file.  It was a simple MACD crossover analysis.
The process, according to 'top', was using about 99% of CPU at one point
(and possibly continuously) and the analysis had not finished after more
than a minute.  I ended up killing the process to terminate it.
