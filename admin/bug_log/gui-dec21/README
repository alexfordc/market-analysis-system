This bug occurred once, in the GUI, but I was not able to reproduce it
again after 2 or 3 tries.  Here is the bug description from the task 44
entry:

"...
See the screen capture file:

/home/development/jtc/finance/admin/bug_log/gui-dec21/newguibug1.jpg

which illustrates the bug - the top screen - the moving average line
(green) is messed up on the middle Wed. and the last Mon.  (Compare with
the screen on the bottom, which is correct.)  This bug occurred when I was
trying to get the code path in 'process_data ' with the new bug fix to be
executed (null volume dataset), which I did.  Perhaps the bug was related
to that context, though I doubt it.

I tried running a couple more auto-refresh tests to try to duplicate the
bug (with the SMA indicator), but it did not appear - the graph was
correct.  The bug may not be reproducable."

Note: The period type being graphed when the bug appeared was 30-minute.
