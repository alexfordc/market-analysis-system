The mas-1_6_6q-2-linux tag was created on Feb 10, 2004.  It "freezes" the
state of the code, ... to coincide with the 1.6.6q release of MAS for
Linux.  No source files were changed in between the mas-1_6_6q tag and
the mas-1_6_6q-2-linux tag.  Only a few files were changed, such as the
mas.spec file, to make some adjustments for the auto-install facilities of
the Linux version.  The files that changed between the mas-1_6_6q tag and
the mas-1_6_6q-2-linux tag are:

build/config/windows/inno_config.iss
build/rpm/mas.spec
src/mct/config/mctrc-spec.linux
