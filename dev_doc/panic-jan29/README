Some documentation for the panic/core-dump bug that occurred on Jan 29,
2003.  The bug appears unpredictably.  It occurred twice running the
newly compiled mas executable with the finance login, running against the
database with a GUI client.  The 2nd time, I held down Ctl-] to keep
cycling through the tradables and the crash occurred after a couple
minutes.
