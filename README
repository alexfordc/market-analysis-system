This is the root directory for the source code and documentation of the
Technical Analysis Library (TAL).  It contains the following directories and
files:

      doc        - Documentation directory
      src        - TAL source code
      forum.txt  - Eiffel Forum Freeware License text

Directory src contains the directories:

      basic_test_app - A basic test application
      main_test_app  - Primary test application
      library        - Directory structure for the TAL source code

Directories basic_test_app and main_test_app contain Ace files for building
the test applications for TAL.  The environment variable FINANCE will need to
be set to this directory in order to compile the test applications.

The development system is Linux 2.0.28 using the ISE Eiffel 4.2f compiler
and environment.  TAL has not yet been ported to other platforms.

See the file intro in the doc directory for a brief introduction to TAL.

Additionally, the directory ../eiffel_library contains a small component
library used by TAL.
