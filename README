This is the root directory for the source code and documentation of the
Technical Analysis Library (TAL).  It contains the following directories and
files:

      doc        - Documentation directory
      src        - Source code for TAL and applications that use it
      forum.txt  - Eiffel Forum Freeware License text

Directory src contains the directories:

      main_test_app       - Primary test application
      application_library - Classes for building applications with TAL
      library             - Directory structure for the TAL source code

main_test_app contains an Ace file for building a functional test
application for TAL.  In order to compile the test application, the
environment variable FINANCE will need to be set to this directory and
the environment variable EIFFEL_COMPONENT_LIBRARY will need to be set to
the absolute path of the ../eiffel_library directory.

The development system is Linux 2.0.28 using the ISE Eiffel 4.2f compiler
and environment.  TAL has not yet been ported to other platforms.

See the file intro in the doc directory for a brief introduction to TAL.

Additionally, the directory ../eiffel_library contains a small component
library used by TAL.
