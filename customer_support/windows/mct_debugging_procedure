[Procedure for turning the debug-print option on for the MCT]

(Note: These instructions are for NT.  This procedure may be slightly
different on XP or Windows 2000.)

Left-click on the "MAS" icon.
Click on "Properties".
Select the "Shortcut" tab.
In the "Target" slot, add: " -debug".
(Add everything within the double quotes, including the leading space - but
not the quotes.)
Click OK.
Then start up the program by double-clicking on the "MAS" icon.

A "DOS" window will appear with debugging information.
Unfortunately, Windows does not provide a straightforward way to save the
debugging output.  So you will need to note what is printed on the resulting
"DOS" window and manually copy it into a file, or at least provide a
good summary (unless you can figure out a way to redirect the information
automatically into a file).

Then click on "Start a MAS Session".
This will result in more info. being printed in the "DOS" window.
Include this additional info. in your report.
Email me the resulting report.

To turn off the debugging, follow the same procedure as above and remove
" -debug" from the "Target" slot and hit "OK".
