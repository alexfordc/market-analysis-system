# These new indicators are created after the above indicator editing
# in order to use the resulting newly edited values in these indicators.
# Slope of MACD Signal Line Trend indicator and two indicators used
# to make it: Slope of MACD Signal Line Less Than or Equal to -0.175 and
# Slope of MACD Signal Line Greater Than or Equal to 0.175.
# It adds the two indicators: when total is 0, Slope of MACD Signal Line is
# close to 0 (>-.175 and <.175) and the trend is sideways; when the total
# is 1, the Slope of MACD Signal Line is greater than or equal to .175 and
# the trend is upward; when the total is -1, the Slope of MACD Signal Line
# is less than or equal to -.175 and the trend is downward.
