# Buy and sell market analyzers using Slope of Slope of MACD, ADX,
# and EMA >= 10
# NOTE: This script saves each new analyzer right after it is created in
# order to ensure that each has its own copy of its subcomponents.  For
# example, each compound market analyzer created by this script will have
# its own "EMA >= 10" analyzer so that changing the EMA n-value of that
# subcomponent for one analyzer will not affect the EMA n-value of any of
# the other compound analyzers created by this script.  If you want the
# "EMA >= 10" analyzer to be shared so that changing the EMA n-value will
# affect that of the other compound analyzers, remove the 's' (save command)
# just before the last three "Start: ..." comments, so that the compound
# analyzers are saved only after the last one is created.
