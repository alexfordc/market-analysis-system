# Slope of MACD Signal Line Close to Zero indicator and two indicators used
# to make it: Slope of MACD Signal Line Less Than or Equal to -0.175 and
# Slope of MACD Signal Line Greater Than or Equal to 0.175
# It adds the two indicators: when total is 0, Slope of MACD Signal Line is
# close to 0 (>-.175 and <.175); otherwise, the total is either 1 or -1.
