Algorithm for building a MAS release:

Preliminary Tasks (in no particular order):

Make sure the copyright dates are all up to date.
Make sure all documentation is correct and up to date.
Make sure the change logs are up to date for the new release.
Update mas_product_info.e to contain current release date.
Go through the steps from below needed to test the Linux and Windows
   installs - make the release, create the mas*setup.exe file, etc., and
   then do the installs and test that the result works as expected.
If problems occur during a step or if tests are executed that fail, go
   back to the appropriate previous step and continue from there.

Final Steps:

1.  On Linux and Windows, make sure all files in the cvs tree are checked in.
2.  Make sure the cvs tree is completely updated on Linux and Windows.
3.  Run build_linux_mas on Linux to build the Linux executables.
4.  Run build_windows_mas on the Windows machine and copy the resulting
    executables (from .../finance/lib/binaries/windows) to the equivalent
    location on the Linux machine.
5.  Do a bit of testing on the built executables to catch any remaining
    problems.  (Recommended, but not required.)
6.  Run make_docs in the doc directory.
7.  Run make_chart_gui to freshly compile all the java files for the
    charting GUI and put them into a jar file.
8.  Make sure the latest version of the indicators_persist and
    generators_persist files (in build/config) are up to date (by running
    make_indicators or by copying these files after the final Linux test
    install) and make sure the latest version is checked into cvs.  These
    files will be copied, in the 'make_release' step below, into the
    ~release/mas-{vrsn#}/mas_windows{vrsn#}.tar.gz file, which will be
    used by inno setup when it builds the windows setup*.exe file.
9.  Make sure the current release directory is empty and run make_release.
10. Do a test install of mas_linux*.tar.gz and make sure it installs
    correctly.
11. Run build_rpm to make the mas rpm file and verify that it was built
    correctly.
12. On the windows machine, run prepare_windows_setup to copy the tar file
    of the windows release over to the windows machine and extract it into
    the source directory for the inno setup process.
13. Run Inno config on the latest inno_config iss file using the source
    files set up by prepare_windows_setup to create the Windows
    setup*.exe file.
14. Run a test install of the Windows setup-mas* exe file on Windows and
    of the mas-*.rpm on Linux.  Fix any problems that come up and, if
    necessary, go back to a previous step.
    NOTE: rpm runs "strip -R .comment -R .note" on the executables, so they
    are not going to be the same as the ones used to build the rpm package.
15. Do a cvs tag, using the current release number as a label.
16. Create a new release-announcement file, perform any needed updates for
    the new release on published files, such as the files accessible on
    sf.net.  Do any needed backups.
17. Put the files for the new release, from the current release directory,
    onto the download section on sourceforge.  Post announcements to
    sourceforge and the appropriate newsgroups - comp.os.linux.announce,
    misc.invest.*, the windows groups, etc.
