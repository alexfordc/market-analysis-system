# The time at which to attempt to retrieve the latest end-of-day data from
# the http data-source site.  It should be in the user's local time.
# This needs to be set carefully: Too early and a lot of time will be wasted
# trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist yet; too late and your data
# will not be as up-to-date as it could be.  Format: hh:mm (24-hour clock)
