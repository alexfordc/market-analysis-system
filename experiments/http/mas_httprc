# Specification of lines from the output (for the data retrieval for a
# single tradable symbol) that should ignored - format:
# postitive_integer: line count from the beginning of the output stream
# where the first line is counted as 1
# negative_integer: line count from the end of the output stream where the
# last line is counted as -1, next-to-last line as -2, etc.
# Example specifying to ignore the first, last and next-to-last lines:
# eod_result_ignore_lines	1,-1,-2
eod_result_ignore_lines	1

# The format of the resulting end-of-day data sent back from the http data-
# source site
# This spec. is for yahoo:
# Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
# 9-Jul-02,71.40,72.25,69.45,69.67,11165600
eod_result_format	<day>-<mon>-<yy>,<o>,<h>,<l>,<c>,<v>
eod_result_format	<day>-<month3>-<yy>,<o>,<h>,<l>,<c>,<v>
# Meaning of the above specification:
# <day>: Day of the month; <month3>: Month as a 3-letter abbreviation
# (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec);
# <yy>: Year in 2-digit format (e.g., 02 is 2002, 96 is 1996, etc.)
# <o>: open; <h>: high; <l>: low; <c>: close; <v>: volume

# The time at which to attempt to retrieve the latest end-of-day data from
# the http data-source site.  It should be in the user's local time.
# This needs to be set carefully: Too early and a lot of time will be wasted
# trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist yet; too late and your data
# will not be as up-to-date as it could be.  Format: hh:mm (24-hour clock)
