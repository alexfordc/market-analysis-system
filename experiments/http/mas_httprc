# Prototype http configuration file

# Specification for the start and end dates for the data to be retrieved
# "now" means, of course, the current date; if an actual date is used,
# it must be of the form: yyyymmdd.

# The path component of the http URL used to retrieve market data

# Path of the file that contains the list of symbols for the tradables to
# be downloaded.  (In this case it's expected to be in the current

# The field separator to use for output when converting the retrieved data
# Must be just one character; If not specified, comma will be used.

# The command to post-process the retrieved data, usually for the purpose of
# converting it into an expected format.  In this case, the specification

# The time at which to attempt to retrieve the latest end-of-day data from
# the http data-source site.  It should be in the user's local time.
# This needs to be set carefully: Too early and a lot of time will be wasted
# trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist yet; too late and your data
# will not be as up-to-date as it could be.  Format: hh:mm (24-hour clock)
eod_turnover_time	18:00

# These specifications prevent unecessary retrieval of data on a weekend
# if the current time is later than eod_turnover_time.  If data does need
# to be retrieved, remove or comment out the appropriate specification;
# for example, if a tradable is traded on Saturday and end-of-day data for
# it is available, comment out the "ignore_weekday	saturday"
# specification.
ignore_weekday	saturday
ignore_weekday	sunday
