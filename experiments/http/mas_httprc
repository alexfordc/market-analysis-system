# The command to post-process the retrieved data, usually for the purpose of
# converting it into an expected format.  The following example, if
# uncommented, will specify a program or script named convert_data (if
# it's in the users's path):
# post_process_command	external:convert_data
#
# 'external' specifies that an external program is to be executed.  If
# convert_data is not in the user's path, the full path to the file needs
# to be specified.  The following line specifies that the inernal
# conversion component called "yahoo" is to be used, rather than executing
# an external program.  (As of July 2002, this is the only internal
# conversion component available; more may be added later.)
post_process_command	internal:yahoo

# The time at which to attempt to retrieve the latest end-of-day data from
# the http data-source site.  It should be in the user's local time.
# This needs to be set carefully: Too early and a lot of time will be wasted
# trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist yet; too late and your data
# will not be as up-to-date as it could be.  Format: hh:mm (24-hour clock)
