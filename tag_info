Information on cvs tags for MAS (Started on Tue Feb  8 17:56:41 MST 2005)

mas-1_6_6u16:

Tag was created on Feb 8, 2005, around 18:00 MST.  This is the version
of the latest compiled mas executable that I released to Orest Lebedovych
as of Feb 8, 2005.  I created the tag to create a snapshot of this stable
version that I released to Orest and to allow me to safely continue with
some experimental, somewhat major changes to the data-scanning/inputting
components such that if the changes don't work, I can "back out" to
the version as of this tag.  It's been at least several days (again,
as of Feb 8, 2005) since I've checked in any changes to the Eiffel code,
but the open-source GUI was modified and checked into cvs last night.
However, I regard this version of the GUI, which includes the
auto-data-refresh changes for Orest, as stable.


tradable_cache_optimization_experiment:

Originally named data_scanning_redesign_experiment before it was renamed
(with admin -noldname:newname; admin -n oldname) to
tradable_cache_optimization_experiment, this tag is for a branch created to
hold the changes I made several days ago for experimenting with a cache of
STORABLE tradables.  It also had some changes to the new schme in
INPUT_FILE such that all lines are read into an array, which is then used
to parse each record into fields in order; and it had a few small
changes/improvements.


data_scanning_input_redesign_feb-2005

Branch for experimenting with a redesign/refactoring of the components in
eiffel_library/data_scanning/input_mechanisms and the tradable_list-related
components for the purpose of "plugging in" input using a network socket.
(See the files:
eiffel_library/data_scanning/input_mechanisms/input_socket.e
finance/src/extended_server/tradable_list/input_socket_connection.e
finance/src/extended_server/tradable_list/socket_tradable_list.e
finance/src/extended_server/tradable_list_builders/socket_list_builder.e
.)

On Sat Feb 12 12:18:38 MST 2005, these changes were tested successfully
with file, database, and web-based input source functionality to make
sure that no defects were introduced; and then the changes were merged into
the main branch.  Therefore, development on the branch will probably cease.
