                  Informal Agreement for MAS Testers


This agreement is with respect to components of the Market Analysis System
(MAS), some of which are not open source and may be released later as part
of a commercial product.

If you continue to be a tester and provide informal feedback on new
releases, we will make all test releases that we send you and the first
official finished release available to you to use for no charge, with the
following restrictions: You cannot share any of the test releases nor the
finished release with anyone else.  And none of the released packages
can be used for commercial purposes other than for one's own trading.
(For example, they can be used for one's personal trading, but not to
provide services that are sold to someone else.)

Technical support for the finished version will not be guaranteed,
although we may be able to provide some support.  Of course, if you
decide at some point before the finished version is released that you
no longer want to be a tester, you still get to keep the test releases
that you have received.
