Capability to specify and calculate indexes

Ideas for implementation

It would probably need to somehow fit into the current scheme where the
client asks for the data for an indicator/symbol/period-type or (for
market data) symbol/period-type.  For an index, the client could ask for: 
index_name/period-type.  The result of an index would probably be the same
field set as the symbols used to construct it - e.g., date,o,h,l,c,v, so
a request for an index could probably be classified as a "market data"
request, rather than an "indicator data" request.  Indicators could, of
course be applied to indexes.  This implies that in the server an index
would be a descendant of TRADABLE.

The index mechanism should be designed to be flexible and, perhaps, allow
similar constructs that are not actually indexes.  It can probably be
thought of

If an index is a TRADABLE (It might be called something like
COMPOSITE_TRADABLE), instead of its data being inserted by calling
make_from_array (as happens to SIMPLE_FUNCTIONs in set_innermost_input of
MARKET_DATA_FUNCTION), its data will be calculated based on its composite
input.  Probably, the COMPOSITE_TRADABLE will know what symbols will be
used to make its data and will be able to take the data for each symbol to
produce its own data, using an operator (which in most cases will be:
                    MULTIPLICATION
     BASIC_NUMERIC_COMMAND   NUMERIC_VALUE_COMMAND

but can be more complex).  The COMPOSITE_TRADABLE will probably have to have an
operator for each of its components, because, for example, stock A might
have a "weight" of 1.25, while stock B has a weight of 1.3.
