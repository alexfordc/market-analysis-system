(From Pedro's email)

I was also thinking of the possibiltiy of linking mas with a library based sql 
database (mysql has one) that way if we have a standalone mas it could 
directly connect to its own database and download from the websites into the 
database without the user having to setup a complex external data source, of 
course we could leave the user the possibility of linking to an external data 
source but not obligate them to. Not sure if this is feasible in eiffel or 
what you think of the idea?
