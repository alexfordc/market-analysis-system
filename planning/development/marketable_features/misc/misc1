        How about:

	I wonder if you had other developers working on this, whether 
	the workload would be less per person.  If so, then having
	an open sourced Eiffel would make it easier for other coders
	to join the effort.  I understand the "a lot of work" comment 
	all too well though.

	It was looking something like that to me given the dates
	on TAL and MAS.  But, it's hard to tell w/o being more 
	familiar with the source.

	Some features I'd like to see are:

	- Some way to test (possibly fictitious) data against 
	  indicators, analyzers and events.

	- Visual indicators for events on the magc graphs.

	- More access to the interactive (command line) commands
	  through the magc interface.

	- A more holistic set of documentation.  I might be able to 
	  help with this one, once I understand the system better.

	Yeeha.

	Thanks for your patience with me.  Cheerio....
