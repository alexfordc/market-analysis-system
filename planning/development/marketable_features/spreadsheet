I was thinking after reading how metastock does it to do this with a 
spreadsheet format as similar initially to metastocks (which I haven't seen) 
rather than as a programming language which would be more difficult for us to 
implement and for the end user to use, what do you think? That way anyone 
could make an indicator in minutes :)
