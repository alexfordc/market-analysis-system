Hi Giancarlo - A Risk/Reward Ratio (RRR) is one form of RAR or Risk Adjusted
Return.  Any RAR is essentially the ratio of the annualized return % divided
by some % measure of risk.  The differences between any of them comes down
in the end to how risk is defined and measured. The worth of any given
trading system to an investor depends in large degree on the circumstances
and trading style of the individual estimating that worth. Each person has
his or her own unique objectives, resources, and risk tolerance, and no
single estimate of Risk Adjusted Return is likely to satisfy everyone.

Some Risk/Reward Ratios which have been suggested in the literature are: the
Largest Loss Ratio or the largest loss divided by the net profit looking for
a ratio of 0.1 or less, the Maximum Drawdown Ratio or the maximum adverse
excursion (MAE) divided by the net profit looking for a ratio of 0.1 or
less, and the Average Run-Up/Drawdown Ratio or the average of the maximum
favorable excursion (MFE) figure for each trade divided by the average
drawdown looking for a ratio of 1.5 or more.

RRR's are also often given as Reward/Risk Ratios looking for larger numbers.
In this view, your friends 99.4% would mean an RRR of .994 which isn't very
good.  Some general "rules (read guidelines)" that have been around in
futures trading for a very long time with regard to other Reward/Risk
measures are that, given that preservation of capital is the principle
driver, RRR's of less than 2 are generally not considered acceptable unless
substantially offset by other risk mitigation techniques. Most professional
traders whom I've seen comment on this subject prefer systems with RRR's of
3 or better.  Some more sophisticated trading systems will make on-the-fly
decisions about each individual trade as to whether to take a trade or not
based on the computed RRR of the trade.  Those that I'm aware of this type
all use RRR's of 3. or better for this purpose

Perhaps this will help you a little.  Regards, Jim Byrd
