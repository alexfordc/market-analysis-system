 This thread seems to have attracted alot of Traders.
 it's obvious each trader will want certain different setups for their sftwr.
 Why dont we start listing here our fave "chart function" Wishes for Bob to consider putting in his program.
 Whats the wildest thing you've always wished for in a chart program but have never seen yet ?

 heres one i've wished for for awhile :

  On the chart---i'd like to be able to Touch (mouse click) and entry price, stoploss point, and target price---and
automatically (maybe on a side pane) show me the Win/Loss ratio, the % to gain, and % to loss real quickly.

 whats your wishes ?
