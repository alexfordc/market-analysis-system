I suppose, he probably means the ratio of his average win to his average
loss. Some call it a payoff ratio. Average win (loss) is the sum of all
winning (losing) trades divided by the total # of wining (losing)  trades.

> He also says that his "performance" is 84%

"Performance"  is a percentage of winning trades that is: # of winnig trades
divided by the total # of all trades (winning and  losing ones).

>but I am not sure how I can transform this into a "profit factor"
> (maybe: 84/16 ?)

Profit factor is the gross profit divided by the gross loss, that is:
(average win * # of winning trades)/(average loss * # of losing trades)
which equals: payoff ratio * (# of winning trades/# of losing trades) . If
you know only a payoff ratio and a percentage of winnig trades you have 3
unknowns (# of winning trades, # of losing trades, profit factor) and only 2
equations (for a percentage of winning trades and for a profit factor), that
is there is unsufficient input data to solve that system of equations what
means it is impossible to transform the data you have into a profit factor.

Hope it helps,

Marek
