Thanks for your reply.. It wasn't too hard once I got the hang of it.

Some things that would be really cool are -
 toggle indicators on re-selection,
 scripting interface to indicator/analyzer generator,
 change time frames interactively rather than thru .clientrc

If I get a bit of time, I might look into these [depending on how badly
I need them!] in which case I'll mail in patches. :)

Again Thx,
SI
