*On the Start of the J-*Stock Index **Calculation* and Selection of
J-Stock Issues *
February 28, 2002
JASDAQ Market Inc.
On April 1, 2002, JASDAQ Market Inc. will begin to select stocks that
meet certain
criteria such as market capitalization and current profit. The selection
will be made from
the stocks listed on the JASDAQ market. JASDAQ Market Inc. will announce
the
“J-*Stock Index*” based on such stocks and calculated by the weighted
average method.
Here we want to explain the background to the introduction of the
J-*Stock Index*, the
criteria for selecting stocks that constitute the index, the method of
*calculation*, and the
method of announcement.
1.
Background to the introduction of the J-*Stock Index*
In view of the fact that such stock price indices as the Nikkei 225, New
York Dow
and NASDAQ 100, representing the markets in and outside of Japan, are being
used effectively, the development of a new stock price index that
represents the
JASDAQ market is an urgent task.
The JASDAQ INDEX now in use covers all JASDAQ stocks, and the
JASDAQ-Bloomberg INDEX consists of stocks that rank high in “market
capitalization” and stocks rated high in “market capitalization + daily
trading
value.” The new stock price index, on the other hand, will be developed
as a
compact one that can be used for diverse purposes as a new benchmark for
and a
core of the JASDAQ market.
The new stock price index is intended to serve as a foothold for the
introduction of
stock price index futures trading and implementation of exchange traded
funds
(ETFs).

day of
listing.

selection belongs) is less than ¥3 billion.
The first day of selection that

condition occurs.
4. The method to calculate the J-*Stock Index*
(1) Benchmark date of the J-*Stock Index*
The benchmark for the J-*Stock Index* is the market capitalization of
all the
J-Stock issues as of February 28, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as “the
benchmark market capitalization”). With the market capitalization at
3:00 p.m.
on that day assumed as 1,000, every business day’s market capitalization is
expressed as an index.
(2) Stock prices adopted in *calculation*
The following priorities of stock prices are used in calculating the
J-*Stock ***
* *
***Index*:
① Price limit quotes at the time of *calculation*
② Execution price available immediately before the *calculation*
③ Average of the quotes for selling and buying
④ Basic price of the day
4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 5*

(3) The method of *calculation* (weighting)
By adopting the method of *calculation* where the average is weighted by
the
number of shares of each J-*Stock Index* issue listed on the JASDAQ market,
the J-*Stock Index* has become less vulnerable to any impact from the
fluctuations of a small number of high-priced stocks. This is based on the
philosophy that a stock with a greater number of shares listed on the
JASDAQ
market can have a greater impact than a stock with a fewer number of
shares,
given the same width of stock price fluctuations.
(4) Method to calculate the J-*Stock Index*
The J-*Stock Index* is calculated in the following manner:
J-*Stock Index* = Benchmark market capitalization at the time of
*calculation*
Benchmark market capitalization
=
∑ Number of listed shares x stock price adopted
Benchmark market capitalization
x 1,000
J-*Stock Index* =
=
x 1,000
(Unit: Points rounded off to the second decimal place)
(5) Revision of the benchmark market capitalization
When the market capitalization is changed by the increase or decrease in
the
number of shares as a result of the new listing on the JASDAQ market,
revocation of the listing on the JASDAQ market, increase in paid-in
capital,
merger and acquisition, etc, the benchmark market capitalization is
revised with
a view to maintaining the continuity of a stock price index.
Revision of the benchmark market capitalization is based on
*calculation* by the
following formula.
Revised benchmark market capitalization
= Market capitalization on the day before ± amount of increase or decrease
Market capitalization on the day before
=
Current benchmark
market capitalization
x
The following describes the occurrences that require revisions, the
timing of
revisions, and the stock price adopted:
5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 6*

Occurrences that require
revisions
Timing of revision
Stock price to be adopted
New listing on the JASDAQ
market
The day after the
date of listing
Closing market price on the
date of listing on the market
Revocation of listing on the
JASDAQ market
The date of the
revocation of
listing
Closing market price on the
day before the date of the
revocation of listing on the
market
Ex-rights due to an increase
in paid-in capital
The date of
ex-rights
Amount of paid-in capital
per share
Public stock offering,
allocation of new shares to a
third party, and mergers
The date of
alteration to listing
Closing market price on the
day before the date of
alteration to listing on the
market
Conversion of convertible
bonds to stocks
End of the
following month
Closing market price on the
day before the last day of
the following month
Incidentally, revision of the benchmark market capitalization shall not
take place
in such cases as a share split (including free quota and scrip issue)
which do create
additional shares but do not involve capital paid-up; and capital
reduction, since
these will not change the market capitalization itself.
5.
Announcement of the J-*Stock Index*
JASDAQ Market Inc. announces the J-*Stock Index* (final report) computed
on the
basis of the closing market price at 3:00 p.m. on each business day on the
information delivery screen within the JASDAQ system and website of JASDAQ
Market Inc.
During the period from February 28 to March 29, 2002, JASDAQ Market Inc.
will announce the J-*Stock Index* (final report) in its homepage on the
following
business day.
6.
Characteristics of the J-*Stock Index*
(1) It clarifies the trends of stocks whose market capitalization is large
The J-*Stock Index* enables you to catch the trends of stocks with big
growth
potential and a large market capitalization. The effect of a stock price
change of
the same amplitude on the J-*Stock Index* differs between a stock where the
number of shares listed in the JASDAQ market is large and a stock where the
6
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Page 7*

number of shares listed in the JASDAQ market is small. Therefore, the
J-*Stock ***
* *
***Index* is calculated by using a weighted average method, the weight
being the
number of shares of each J-Stock issue listed in the JASDAQ market.
(2) It accurately shows the present conditions of the market
You may think that an index for the JASDAQ market lacks continuity because
there are often new entries and also delisting. Inasmuch as the J-*Stock
Index*
covers the stocks that represent the JASDAQ market, however, it is more
reasonable to think that the J-*Stock Index* has continuity as an index
that shows
the trends in stocks that represent the JASDAQ market because the condition
for adoption for the index is that only stocks that meet the criteria
for selection
constitute the index.
(3) A new concept
Because the criteria for selection for the J-*Stock Index* are uniform
external
criteria that include current profit as a condition for eligibility, the
J-*Stock ***
* *
***Index* is a clear, transparent one. Moreover, because the number of
stocks that
constitute the J-*Stock Index* is not fixed but all stocks that meet the
criteria are
added to it, the J-*Stock Index* accurately mirrors the trends in the
stock groups
that represent the JASDAQ market.
(4) Comparison with other international markets
The stock price index computed by the market capitalization weighted
average method has already been established as common practice in the stock
markets overseas, making it possible to compare the performance of the
JASDAQ market with that of the other major stock markets. It should be
pointed out that American indices covering stock markets, such as NASDAQ
and RUSSELL2000 among other indices, are employing this method,
enhancing the value of the JASDAQ INDEX as a tool to compare the
JASDAQ market of Japan on a par with international markets.
