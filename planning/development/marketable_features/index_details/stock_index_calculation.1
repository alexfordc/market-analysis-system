"The basic formula to *calculate* an index EPS is:

    (equity weight * trailing 12 month EPS) / index divisor

    sum this up for each equity

"*if the index is a capitalization-weighted index then weight refers to
 outstanding shares, if it's price-weighted then weight equals 1.00

    Example for a capitalization-weighted index:

        Stock    Weight     EPS                Divisor
          A      50.00  *   6.5  =   325.0  /   10.25   =   31.71
          B      75.00  *   8.0  =   600.0  /   10.25   =   58.54
          C      10.00  *   3.0  =    30.0  /   10.25   =    2.93

                                                Index EPS=  93.18
                                              Index Value= 100.00
                                                Index P/E=   1.07

"The index P/E will equal: Index Value / Index EPS

"In some cases we will not have 100% EPS coverage for each equity in an
index.
If this is the case then we can't simply throw out those values and
continue
to *calculate* the index EPS the same way.  The current index divisor
(which is
a major variable in the index EPS calculation) is based upon the current
members of the index and their current market value.  If certain stocks
do not
have EPS coverage then we must throw out those stocks from the
calculation and
recalculate a new index market value and index divisor.  Let's assume
that
Stock C has no EPS coverage:

    Example (before throwing out Stock C):
                                     Market
        Stock    Weight     Price    Value
          A      50.00  *   10.0 =   500.00
          B      75.00  *    5.0 =   375.00
          C      10.00  *   15.0 =   150.00

                Total Market Value= 1025.00
                           Divisor=   10.25
                       Index Value=  100.00

"   Since Stock C has no EPS coverage we need to recalculate the index
   market value so we can recalculate the index divisor to be used in
   the Index EPS calculation.
                                    Market
       Stock    Weight     Price    Value
         A      50.00  *   10.0 =   500.00
         B      75.00  *    5.0 =   375.00

            Adjusted Market Value=  875.00
                 Adjusted Divisor=    8.75
                      Index Value=  100.00

*the formula to *calculate* the adjusted divisor is:

                    Adjusted Market Value / Index Value

"  Now that we have calculated the adjusted index divisor we can
  *calculate* the index EPS.
                                             Adjusted
      Stock    Weight     EPS                Divisor
        A      50.00  *   6.5  =   325.0  /   8.75    =   37.14
        B      75.00  *   8.0  =   600.0  /   8.75    =   68.57

                                     Adjusted Index EPS= 105.71
                                            Index Value= 100.00
                                     Adjusted Index P/E=    .95

"  Here's what would have happened if we didn't recalculate the index
  divisor even if Stock C had no EPS coverage.

      Stock    Weight     EPS                Divisor
        A      50.00  *   6.5  =   325.0  /   10.25   =   31.71
        B      75.00  *   8.0  =   600.0  /   10.25   =   58.54
        C      10.00  *   NA   =    00.0  /   10.25   =    0.00

                                              Index EPS=  90.25
                                            Index Value= 100.00
                                              Index P/E=   1.11

"You can see the difference in P/E when we don't use Stock C and
recalculate
the index divisor (.95) versus when we keep it in there and don't adjust
the
index divisor (1.11).  This may seem like a very small difference, but
this is
only a 3 *stock index*.  This method can really make a difference when a
larger
index is being used or when there are multiple stocks with no EPS
coverage.

"When looking at the function GE, the P/E that is being displayed is the
adjusted P/E using the adjusted index divisor (if there isn't 100% EPS
coverage).  The EPS that is displayed is the actual EPS using the actual
index
divisor.  For this reason you won't always be able to divided the index
price
by the EPS found on GE to equal the P/E found on GE.  If this does equal
then
it means that there is 100% EPS coverage for every equity in the index.

"The calculation for the estimated EPS and estimated P/E use the same
exact
methodology. The estimated EPS values for each equity are derived from
IBES,
except Japanese EPS values are derived from Toyo Keizai.

In the case of negative earnings, they would be simply added to the
index EPS weighted by their capitalization.
