------------------------------------------------------------------------

*1. Characteristics*

Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. created The Nikkei Stock Index 300 (Nikkei
300) to provide a representative gauge of the overall market. The new
index has a base value of 100 as of October 1, 1982, and has been
calculated every minute since January 31, 1994. For before then, daily
indices are available.

*Market value-weighted index of 300 stocks*

The Nikkei 300 is a market value-weighted index of the 300 major issues
selected to represent listed stocks on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. The index not only serves as an important indicator of
the economy but meets the broad needs of investors.

*Accurate measure of market value*

The Nikkei 300 uses a weighted average based on market capitalizations
of component firms to reflect movements in the overall value of first
section stocks. This contrasts with the widely followed Nikkei Stock
Average which is an average price and is suitable for monitoring the
level of the market and its changes.

*High total balance*

The index is well balanced in terms of liquidity, stability and
industrial sectors. In addition, the components are reviewed annually to
reflect changes in the market environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*2. Deletion & Addition Rules*

Components can be deleted or added either at the annual review or when
circumstances change.

*(2-1) Screening criteria*

The index is comprised of stocks with the largest market value in 36
industrial sectors.

Components must be listed on the first section of the TSE and not show
any of the following characteristics:
1) A conspicuously low traded day ratio for a first section stock
2) A conspicuously low trading volume
3) A conspicuously low volume-to-outstanding shares ratio
4) An abrupt shift in ranking for volume-to-outstanding shares ratio
from the previous year
5) No dividend for a considerable period
6) Pretax losses posted for a considerable period
7) Debt exceeds assets for successive accounting periods

*(2-2) Selection of stocks*

*(2-2-1)* The index is reviewed every September. Changes, if any, become
effective from early October. A review does not necessarily result in
changes.

Stocks cannot be added if they have been listed on the TSE for less than
two years. There is no limit to the number of additions/deletions.

The review is carried out in two steps:

(1) Selection of addition/deletion candidates

Stocks that fit any of the following conditions are candidate for
addition/deletion:

* Stocks that fail to meet the criteria set out above are removed. New
candidates are selected from stocks that fit the criteria.

* Stocks can be added if they contributed to an increase in the total
market value of eligible stocks from the previous year. The total market
value is the average of the past three years. But a stock will not be
added if it is relatively small in terms of market value in its
industrial sector.

* Component issues may be deleted if their share of the market value
within the industry has become relatively low.

* Non-component stocks may be added if their share of the market value
within the industry has become relatively high.

The 36 industrial sectors are chosen by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.

(2) Adjustment process

Once the review of suitable candidates for addition/deletion is
completed, the following criteria are used to ensure the number of
components remains at 300:

As the first step, a coverage ratio is calculated for each of 36
sectors. A coverage ratio for a particular industrial sector is defined
as proportion of the aggregate market capitalization of component stocks
against the total market value of the sector. Then:

* In the case of a shortage, a stock will be added which has the largest
market value in the industrial sector with the lowest coverage ratio.
The process is repeated until the number of components reaches 300.

* In the case of an excess, the deleted stock will have the lowest share
of market value in the industry with the highest coverage ratio.

*(2-2-2)* Special reasons for deletion

Any component stock shall be deleted from the index should it become
unauthorized to be traded on the TSE first section for any of the
following reasons:

a. Bankruptcy
b. Merger into or acquisition by another company
c. Delisting or moving to "Seiri-Post" (liquidation post at an exchange
which means the decision to delist the share has been made) or
"Kanri-Post" (supervision post to warn investors of the possibility the
issue may be delisted) categories because of excess debt, etc.
d. Move to the second section of the exchange

The stock will be replaced by the stock with the largest market value in
the industry with the lowest coverage ratio.

*(2-2-3)* Special reasons for addition

A new stock may be added as a special case if it is recognized as
representing the market and industry. It will replace the
least-capitalized component stock in that industry.

Removal/addition of stocks is determined and announced by Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, Inc. after consulting with various experts.

*(2-3) Note on pre-1993 components*

To calculate the index from 1982 to 1993, constituents were selected for
each year using the following criteria:

Stocks were selected in descending order of market value in each
industrial sector, with those with the largest market value in each
industry selected automatically.

From the eligible stocks, constituents with the largest market value
were then chosen in each of the industries. The coverage ratio of each
sector was kept as uniform as possible across all industries. The
process continued until the number of constituents reached 300.

Unlike the annual review that started in 1994, the constituents were
newly selected each year without regard to the previous constituents.
For calculating the back history of the index, new constituents were
used from the first trading day of October. Constituents before 1992 are
not released publicly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*3. Calculation method*

The basic method of calculating the index is described below. This
conforms to the method generally known as the "market-value weighted
average".

Under this method, the market value of each constituent stock is
computed by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares
outstanding (excluding government-owned shares). These amounts are then
totaled to obtain the "total market value" for all of the constituent
stocks. The index is calculated by dividing the current total market
value by the total market value on the base date (Oct. 1, 1982) and
multiplying the result by 100.

Index = Sum of market value of constituent stocks / total market value
on the base date x 100

*(1) Market value for the calculation *

Market Value = Stock price x No. of shares

*1)* Priority in usage of prices is as follows:

1. Current special quotation (final special quotation)
2. Current price (closing price)
3. Standard price which is defined as follows:

The theoretical price of ex-rights, a special quotation from the
previous day or closing price of the previous day (in this order of
priority).

The prices given in parentheses are used to calculate the index after
the close.

*2)* The number of shares is the number of outstanding shares as of that
day, excluding government-owned shares.

*(2) Adjustment of divisor*

Total market value on the base date is the "divisor". The divisor is
adjusted to maintain continuity in the index when the market value of
constituents changes for non-market reasons.

* adjustment is the sum of the changes in the market value of the
constituents

*1)* The divisor can be adjusted for the following reasons:

1. Replacement of a stock (deletion/addition)

2. Change in the number of shares for any the following reasons:

a) An increase in capital by a non-gratis allocation to shareholders
b) An increase in capital by a public offering or allocation to a third
party
c) Merger
d) Conversion of warrants, CBs or preferred stocks to common stocks,
stock buyback by an issuer (A stock split, change in par value or a
decrease in capital do not constitute reasons for adjusting the divisor.)

*2)* Date of adjustment

1. Replacement of a stock: on the day the stock is replaced.

2. Non-gratis allocation to shareholders: ex-right date.

3. Public offering or allocation to a third party: on the following day
of the paid-in date.

4. Merger: on the day of merger.

5. Conversion of warrants, CBs, or preferred stock, stock buybacks: on
the next date specified in the market report for the TSE

*3)* Adjustment method

The divisor is adjusted to ensure that the following holds true:

New divisor = Old divisor * { market value on the previous day (+/-)
adjustment } / market value on the previous day

*Adjustment for each event is calculated according to the following table: *

Event Adjustment
Gratis
None
Non-Gratis Add (Per-share paid-in amount x number of new shares)
Public Offering Add (Offer price x number of new shares)
Change In Dividend None
Conversion Add (Price used to calculate index on previous day x number
of additional shares)
Capital decrease None
Stock Split None
Stock Buyback Subtract (Price used to calculate the index on the
previous day x number of shares decreased by buy back)
