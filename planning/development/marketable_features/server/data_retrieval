Potential useful features related to data retrieval


Send the server a list of tradables to use:

  - In addition to its current list.
  - Instead of its current list.


Have the server obtain the latest data:

  - On request from the user.
  - At regular intervals (e.g., every minute)
  - Whenever new data becomes available.

[Implementation note: The above three items might all be best implemented
via a "controller daemon" that requests that the server reread its data.
For the first item it could, e.g., forward the request to the server; for
the 2nd item it would use a timer to send the requests every n seconds;
for the 3rd item it would either check for new data every n seconds or
would be notified, via some kind of "notification interface", when new data
is available.  When it's time to look at adding this feature, consider the
advantages and the disadvantages vs. other designs, such as having the
server do all of this work.  A main advantage is that the server would
remain simple and flexible - flexible because different requirements or
algorithms for determining when to get new data can be implemented in one
or more controller clients; the server would just do what it's told.  It
would respond promptly to any get-new-data request unless it was overloaded
with GUI requests or was serving a macl session.]

The data-retrieval requirements for an "enterprise server" version would
probably be different than for an "individual" version.  For example,
"On request from the user" may not be appropriate (although it could
possibly be replaced with ""On request from the administrator".)  The other
two may both be appropriate, although they will probably need to be
configured by an administrator.
