Since macl hogs the server and power users and institutional users are
likely to run into problems with that: e.g., a request is sent to the
server to read its latest data, but the server does not respond because
it's busy with macl, use of macl needs to be made asynchronous - either by
means of threads or a fork, or (this is probably the easiest and may be
adequate) marking a particular server process as for non-persistent
connections only; no macl connections would be allowed.  A separate process
could be run to services any needed macl connections.
