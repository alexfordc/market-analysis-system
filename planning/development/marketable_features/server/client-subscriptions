"Enterprise" users could run the mas server on a powerful server machine
and provide subscription services to many clients; the most typical
example of this would be to dispatch trading signals (via email, IM,
or other media) to the clients.  This could be in the context of web
services, but should also include non-web media to allow immediate
notification.  For example, for many users, a message to their cell phone
or pager delivered via email or IM would reach them right away without
their having to put effort into checking for signals with their browser.
