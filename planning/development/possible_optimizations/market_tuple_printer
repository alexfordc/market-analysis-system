In the function:

	last_date_time_index (l: MARKET_TUPLE_LIST [MARKET_TUPLE]): INTEGER is

it is likely that the "print end date/time" will be close to the current
time (re. the "time-delimited data request" feature).  To take advantage of
that, it might be optimal to, before calling l.index_at_date_time, check if
the print-end-date/time is recent and force the search to occur within the
last n data records, so that the resulting binary search is shortened in
terms of needed iterations.

Note that in order to do this some way of forcing the search to occur
beginning at a particular index (or, better, bounded by a start and end
index), which implies changing index_at_date_time or adding a new routine
with the bounds indexes.
