# Example specification for cluster dependency checking with "check_dep"
# Structure: "directory<Tab>rank"
#    Where rank is an integer > 0 - The lower the number, the higher the
#    abstraction level of the associated cluster.  (Higher-level clusters
#    should not have lower-level clusters dependent on them.)
