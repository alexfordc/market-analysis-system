Tips for Constructing Technical Analysis Indicators


When you are constructing the operator tree for an indicator and you want
to use a COMMAND_SEQUENCE but it doesn't appear in the current command
selection list, choose a NUMERIC_VALUED_COMMAND_WRAPPER.  You can then
select a COMMAND_SEQUENCE as the NUMERIC_VALUED_COMMAND_WRAPPER's
"operand".

When you have attempted to construct an indicator with a complex operator
tree and want to view the operator tree to make sure it looks right, run
the mas server with the -debug option and execute the indicator on any
tradable.  Start the server such that the stdout and stderr is captured
into a file.  (On UNIX systems, the script command can be used for this.)
The debugging output resulting from processing the indicator will include
a report of the operator tree state for each period.  You can simply view
the report for the first period, which prints the structure of the operator
tree.
