Installing the Market Analysis Server and Client

Currently, the Market Analysis Server only runs on Linux/Intel platforms.
I have tested it successfully on kernel versions 1.2.13, 2.0.28, and 2.2.9.
I recommend at least a pentium machine to run the server, although I have
run it successfully on my old 80486/33 machine - it's a little slow on that
machine, but it's useable.

You will need the older libc library to run this version of MAS (rather
than the new glibc).  I have included all shared libraries that the server
needs in the lib directory, in case you don't have them.  You can either
copy these (the lib*.so.* files) to /usr/lib, or you can put them in an
alternate place (or leave them where you unpacked them) and add the lib
directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  For example,
if the lib*.so.* files are in /usr/local/lib, you can add that directory
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for the korn shell or bash with the command:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

To install the server executables and the client (Java) class files,
first edit the install_config file in this directory (that is, the same
directory where this INSTALL file resides).  In the line that begins
"bin:", change the second field to the absolute path of the directory
where you want to put the executable files.  In the line that begins
"lib:", change the second field to the absolute path of the directory
where you want to put the MAS library files, including the Java class
files used by the GUI client.

Be sure that you have permission to write to the directories you specified
in the install_config file.  Often the easiest way to do this is to
use su to become root, if you have permission to do that.  Typical choices
for the bin and lib directories are /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib,
but you can specify any directory that you think is appropriate, although
it is probably not wise to use a system directory, such as /usr/bin or
/usr/lib.

Then run the install script from this directory:

./install

If it is not already, you will need to make sure that the bin directory
you installed to is included in your path.

After installation, you should read the file doc/environment for
instructions on setting environment variables needed by the server.

Also, you will need to create a file with stock split information, which
the server will read to adjust its stock data for splits.  (The server
can run without this file, but any data for a stock that has split,
if the split has not been adjusted for in the data file itself, will not
be adjusted for the split by the server and thus incorrect values will
be used when the data for that stock is processed.)  The format of the
stock split file is simple:

date<tab>symbol<tab>value

where date is the date of the split in the format yyyymmdd, <tab> stands
for a tab character, symbol is the symbol for the stock, and value is the
split value.  (For example, for a 2-for-1 split, value will be 2.)

An example of a line in the stock split file that follows this format is:

19980408	F	1.5

The current distribution of MAS includes a file (lib/stock_splits) with
some stock split data in the required format.
