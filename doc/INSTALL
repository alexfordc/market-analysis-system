INSTALLING THE MARKET ANALYSIS SERVER AND CLIENT

Currently, the Market Analysis Server (MAS) runs on Linux/Intel and Windows
platforms.  This version (1.2) of the Linux release requires the new glibc
libraries.  I recommend at least a pentium machine to run the server, since
the intensive math processing it does may make it sluggish on older hardware.


INSTALLATION ON LINUX SYSTEMS

To install the server executables and the client (Java) class files on
a Linux system, first edit the install_config file in this directory
(that is, the same directory where this INSTALL file resides).  In the
line that begins "bin:", change the second field to the absolute path of
the directory where you want to put the executable files.  In the line
that begins "lib:", change the second field to the absolute path of the
directory where you want to put the MAS library files, including the Java
class files used by the GUI client.

Be sure that you have permission to write to the directories you specified
in the install_config file.  Often the easiest way to do this is to
use su to become root, if you have permission to do that.  Typical choices
for the bin and lib directories are /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib,
but you can specify any directory that you think is appropriate, although
it is probably not wise to use a system directory, such as /usr/bin or
/usr/lib.

Then run the install script from this directory:

./install

If it is not already, you will need to make sure that the bin directory
you installed to is included in your path.


GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

After installation, you should read the file doc/environment for
instructions on setting environment variables needed by the server.

Also, you will need to create a file with stock split information, which
the server will read to adjust its stock data for splits.  (The server
can run without this file, but any data for a stock that has split,
if the split has not been adjusted for in the data file itself, will not
be adjusted for the split by the server and thus incorrect values will
be used when the data for that stock is processed.)  The format of the
stock split file is simple:

date<tab>symbol<tab>value

where date is the date of the split in the format yyyymmdd, <tab> stands
for a tab character, symbol is the symbol for the stock, and value is the
split value.  (For example, for a 2-for-1 split, value will be 2.)

An example of a line in the stock split file that follows this format is:

19980408	F	1.5

The current distribution of MAS includes a file (lib/stock_splits) with
some stock split data in the required format.

To test that the installation succeeded, you can run mas on the example data
files in lib/data.  (See the file doc/masystem_introduction for instructions
on how to start mas.)
