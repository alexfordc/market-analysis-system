INSTALLING THE MARKET ANALYSIS SERVER AND CLIENT

Currently, the Market Analysis Server (MAS) runs on Linux/Intel and
Windows platforms.  This version of the Linux release requires the
relatively new glibc libraries.  I recommend at least a pentium machine
to run the server, since the intensive math processing it does may make
it sluggish on older hardware.


INSTALLATION ON LINUX SYSTEMS

To install the server executables and the client (Java) class files on
a Linux system, run the install script from this directory:

./install

The script will ask you to enter the path of the directory in which to
place the executable files.  You can either accept the default choice
by hitting <Enter>, or you can enter an absolute path of an appropriate
directory.  Next it will ask you to enter the path of the directory in
which to place the library files (including the Java class files for the
MAS GUI).  Again, you can either accept the default choice by hitting
<Enter>, or you can enter an absolute path of an appropriate directory.

The script will also check if the dynamic libraries needed by the server
can be found.  Any library it reports as not being found you will need
to obtain and install.  MAS depends on an ODBC library, libodbc.so.1,
that is not part of the standard Linux distribution.  If this library
is reported missing on your system, I have included a copy in the MAS
distribution, which you will find in the lib directory you chose for
MAS's library files.  If this library does not work for you, for some
reason, you may be able to find one that does work on your system at:
  http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libodbc.so.1
(This site was alive and valid as of Jan. 18, 2001.)

Note that if you have an older version of MAS installed in the same
location you choose to install the new version, the old MAS files will
be replaced by the new ones.

If it is not already, you will need to make sure that the bin directory
you installed to is included in your path.


INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS

Note: The string X.X, used below, stands for the version number of the
release of MAS you are installing.  For example, if the version number
is 1.5, you should replace mas_vX.X, below, with mas_v1.5.

Unfortunately, the Windows executable in this release is not fully
functional.  See the file README_WINDOWS.txt for details.

Choose a directory to put the MAS files in and extract the
mas_windowsX.X.tar.gz file or the mas_windowsX.X.zip into this directory.
After extraction, you will find a subdirectory, mas_vX.X, within which the
MAS files reside.

Add the bin directory under mas_vX.X to your path.  For example, if you
installed mas under c:\"Program Files", you could add the following line to
your autoexec.bat file:

PATH=%PATH%;c:\"Program Files"\mas_vX.X\bin

There are three scripts in mas_vX.X\bin you can use to run mas with a
hard-coded port number: runmas.bat, runmasgui.bat, and runmacl.bat.
(runmas.bat starts the server; runmasgui.bat connects a GUI client to that
server, and runmacl.bat starts the command-line client.)  You will need to
set the MAS_DIRECTORY environment variable for these scripts to work
successfully.  Set this variable to the path of the mas_vX.X\lib directory.

For example, if mas_vX.X is under c:\"Program Files", add the following line
to your autoexec.bat file:

set MAS_DIRECTORY=c:\"Program Files"\mas_vX.X\lib

After ensuring that these settings are in your current environment (for
example, by rebooting Windows), you should be able to start the server by
running the runmas.bat script and then start the GUI by running the
runmasgui.bat script.

[To terminate the server, start runmacl.bat and type <Control>E; then hit
enter.]

On Windows, the option is available to use a database management system
with an ODBC interface to hold market data instead of MAS's default
convention of reading the data from files.  This facility was added by
Eirik Mangseth, who is currently using it successfully.  (I have not used
it myself, so I will not be able to help you with questions about how to
configure it.)  Eirik has provided a short document, mas_odbc_usage.txt in
the doc directory, with instructions on how to configure MAS to work with
ODBC.

on how to setup and use MAS.
