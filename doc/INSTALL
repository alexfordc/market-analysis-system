Installing the Market Analysis Server and Client

Currently, the Market Analysis Server only runs on Linux/Intel platforms.
I have tested it successfully on kernel versions 1.2.13, 2.0.28, and 2.2.9.
I recommend at least a pentium machine to run the server, although I have
run it successfully on my old 80486/33 machine - it's a little slow on that
machine, but it's useable.

You will need the older libc library to run this version of MAS (rather
than the new glibc).  I have included all shared libraries that the server
needs in the lib directory, in case you don't have them.  You can either
copy these (the lib*.so.* files) to /usr/lib, or you can put them in an
alternate place (or leave them where you unpacked them) and add the lib
directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  For example,
if the lib*.so.* files are in /usr/local/lib, you can add that directory
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for the korn shell or bash with the command:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

To install the server executables and the client (Java) class files,
first edit the install_config file in this directory (that is, the same
directory where this INSTALL file resides).  In the line that begins
"bin:", change the second field to the absolute path of the directory
where you want to put the executable files.  In the line that begins
"lib:", change the second field to the absolute path of the directory
where you want to put the MAS library files, including the Java class
files used by the GUI client.

Then run the install script from this directory:

./install

If it is not already, you will need to make sure that the bin: directory
you installed to is included in your path.
