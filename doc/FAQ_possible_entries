For the messy "Warning: Cannot convert string "..." to type VirtualBinding"
warning messages that occur when the java GUI starts up (occurs on redhat 7.3
with jdk installed as of sep 7 2002), the problem appears to be an
X-related problem that can be ignored - reference this url if putting it
into the FAQ:

People will probably run into the following problem:

Using http-based data retrieval, if today is Saturday (perhaps this also
occurs on Sunday) and data for "symbol" is only missing for the last day,
yahoo does not give yesterday's data (even though the http query sent by
MAS is correct).  The fix is to remove the data file for "symbol" so that
the data will be retrieved from scratch.  (Deleting the last line in the
data file does not work.)
