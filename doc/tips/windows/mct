Tips for the MAS Control Terminal (MCT) on Windows

Setting up the MCT for debugging:

Right-click on the "Main MAS Terminal" icon
Click on "Properties"
Select "Shortcut"
In the "Target" slot, at the end, add a space and the string -debug (that
   is, " -debug", without the quotes).
Click "OK".

The next time you start the MCT, a window will appear with debugging
information in it.
