BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE MARKET ANALYSIS SYSTEM

The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a client/server application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets, with the goal of
helping its user make better buying and selling decisions and to help
save time by automating some tasks that would otherwise be done by hand.

The principal component of the MAS is the Market Analysis System Server
(MASS) [also called the Market Analysis Server (MAS) in contexts where
it will not be confused with the Market Analysis System].  The server
inputs market data (such as stock data), applies technical analysis[1]
indicators to the data, makes market and indicator data available to
clients via a network connection, and provides configurable analysis of
market data to help determine good buy and sell prospects.[2]

Another important component of the Market Analysis System is the Market
Analysis GUI Client (MAGC) (sometimes shortened to Market Analysis Client
(MAC)).  This application obtains market and indicator data from the
server and displays it in chart form, allowing the user to visualize
the data.  MAS currently runs on Linux x86 and Windows systems.  MAGC should
run on any platform for which a Java Runtime Environment is available,
which includes UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh systems.

See the file "feature_list" for list of features provided by the Market
Analysis System client and server.

Note: The term {mas_dir}, used below, stands for the directory into which
you installed MAS.

RUNNING MAS

Note that before running the Market Analysis Server for the first time,
you will need to set up a few environment variables for it.  See the
file environment for an explanation of these variables.  Also,
the current version of MAS supports any data format that includes
volume.  Open interest is not supported in the current version.
The expected order of fields, when opening price is included is:
date,open,high,low,close,volume.

Note that there are some sample data files in {mas_dir}/lib/data that
you can use to begin with.

There are currently two main ways to use MAS: by running the server
and the GUI client to view charts of markets; and by running the server
alone and using its analysis features to produce buy and sell signals,
based on criteria set by the user.  To use both the server and client,
you will first need to start the server.  Here is an example command-line
entry for starting the server, in a directory that contains market data
files whose names follow the format *.txt:

mas -o -f , *.txt -b 13579 &

The -o tells the server that the data files include an opening price;
the "-f ," tells the server that the character used to separate fields
in the data file is ','.  (The default is tab.)  *.txt, of course,
passes all file names in the current directory that end in .txt to
the server and -b tells the server it is to be run in the background.
13579 is the socket port number that the server will use to communicate
with one or more GUI clients.  (You can enter "mas -h" to print a short
summary of the server's command-line options.)

Once you have started the server, you can start a GUI client from the
command line by changing the current directory to:

{mas_dir}/lib/classes

java MA_Client hostname port_number

where hostname stands for the network name of the computer the server is
running on and port_number is the socket port number the server is using
(13579 in the example above).  Note that since the GUI is a Java program,
you will need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on
your system.  The JRE is available for free for most operating systems.
See the file java_info for information on obtaining the JRE for your
system.

On UNIX systems, you can start a java GUI client by running the magc
command.  For example:

magc 13579

will start the GUI and connect with the server at port 13579.  If the
server is running on a different machine from the client, you can specify
the machine's network address with the -h option.  For example:

magc -h boston.com 13579

when the server is running on a machine named boston.com.

See the file GUI_introduction for more information on running the GUI client.

You can also run the server on intraday data.  One intradata data file
is included in {mas_dir}/lib/data: ibm.5-minute, 5-minute data for IBM.
(Note that this is artificial - made-up - data, since real intraday data
is expensive.)  You can run the server on the daily and intraday data
for IBM with:

mas -o -f , 2425 -b -d txt -i 5-minute ibm.* &

Then start the GUI the same way as before.


[1] For those not familiar with technical analysis, it is a set of
techniques for analyzing market data, using indicators such as trend
lines, moving averages, price momentum, oscillators, etc. to identify
changes in market trends.  It is based on the observation that "prices
move in trends which are determined by the changing attitudes of investors
toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological
forces." ["Technical Analysis Explained," by Martin J. Pring]

[2] For example, one configuration I have used is to issue a buy signal
if Stochastic %D crosses below 35% (indicating that the stock is becoming
oversold) and, no more than 28 days before that, the weekly MACD difference
line crossed above the weekly MACD signal line (indicating that the stock
may be in a long-term uptrend), as well as to issue a sell signal for the
opposite event - Stochastic %D crosses above 65% and weekly MACD difference
line crosses below weekly MACD signal line.
