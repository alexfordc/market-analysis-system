%hdg1Introduction to the Market Analysis Systemhide
The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a client/server application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets, with the goal of
helping its user make better buying and selling decisions and to help
save time by automating some tasks that would otherwise be done by hand.
%par
The principal component of MAS is the Market Analysis System server.
The server
inputs market data (such as stock data), applies technical analysis[1]
indicators to the data, makes market and indicator data available to
clients via a network connection, and provides configurable analysis of
market data to help determine good buy and sell prospects.[2]
%par
Another important component of the Market Analysis System is the Market
Analysis GUI client.
This application obtains market and indicator data from the
server and displays it in chart form, allowing the user to visualize
the data.
MAS currently runs on Linux x86 and Windows systems.
The MAS GUI client should
run on any platform for which a Java Runtime Environment is available,
which includes UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh systems.
%par
See the file "feature_list" for list of features provided by the Market
Analysis System client and server.
%par
*^fontBNote*^fontP: The term {mas_dir}, used below, stands for the
directory into which you installed MAS.

%hdg2Stock Splits

If the data you are using is not automatically adjusted for stock splits,
you will need to use MAS's stock-split adjustment facility to incorporate
stock-split adjustments for each stock data-set processed by MAS.
If you are using MAS with a database system, the stock split data will
come from a table in the database.
@begin:linux
(See *^fontIUsing MAS with a Database Management System on Linux*^fontP
for a description of how to use MAS with a database system.)
@end:linux
@begin:windows
%par
*^fontBNote*^fontP:
The capability to obtain data from a database system is not currently a
supported feature for the Windows version.
It may be available in the future.
@end:windows
%par
If you are not using MAS with a database
system, MAS will attempt to obtain the stock split data from a file.
By default, the file is named mas_stock_splits and resides in
@begin:linux
$MAS_DIRECTORY/lib, or, if MAS_DIRECTORY is not set, in the directory
from which you started the server.
@end:linux
@begin:windows
the lib directory, under the directory into which you installed MAS.
@end:windows
If the stock-split data file does not exist, MAS will not perform
stock-split adjustment.
%par
The format of the stock split file is:
%par
date[tab]symbol[tab]value
%par
where date is the date of the split in the format yyyymmdd, [tab] stands
for a tab character, symbol is the symbol for the stock, and value is the
split value.  (For example, for a 2-for-1 split, value will be 2.)
%par
An example of a line in the stock split file that follows this format is:
%par
19980408	F	1.5
%par
The current distribution of MAS includes a file
@linux(lib/data/stock_splits)
@windows(lib\data\stock_splits)
with some sample stock split data in the required format.


%hdg2Running Mas

@begin:linux
*^fontBNote*^fontP:
Before running the Market Analysis Server for the first time,
you will need to set up a few environment variables for it.  See the
file environment for an explanation of these variables.
@end:linux
%par
The current version of MAS supports the following data formats:
%par
*^fontI
date[time],open,high,low,close,volume
%br
date[time],high,low,close,volume
%br
date[time],open,high,low,close,volume,open-interest
%br
date[time],high,low,close,volume,open-interest
*^fontP
%par
There are some sample data files in
@linux{mas_dir}/lib/data/tradables
@windows{mas_dir}\lib\data
that you can use to try out MAS.
%par
@begin:windows
*^fontBNote*^fontP:
The remainder of this section covers how to run the server and client from
the command line, which provides more flexibility than the method of
starting MAS with the installed desktop icons.
You can skip this section if you are using the desktop icons to start MAS
and you don't need this extra flexibility.
%par
@end:windows
There are currently two main ways to use MAS: by running the server
and the GUI client to view charts of markets; and by running the server
alone and using its analysis features to produce buy and sell signals,
based on criteria set by the user.  To use both the server and client,
you will first need to start the server.  Here is an example command-line
entry for starting the server, in a directory that contains market data
files whose names follow the format *.txt:
%par
mas -o -f , *.txt -b 13579 &
%par
The -o tells the server that the data files include an opening price;
the "-f ," tells the server that the character used to separate fields
in the data file is ','.  (The default is tab.)  *.txt, of course,
passes all file names in the current directory that end in .txt to
the server and -b tells the server it is to be run in the background.
13579 is the socket port number that you are telling the server to use
to communicate with one or more GUI clients.  (You can enter "mas -h"
to print a short summary of the server's command-line options.)
%par
You may want to use the new feature of the server (as of version 1.6.5) to
retrieve the latest end-of-day data from yahoo.com.  To do this, make sure
the mas_httprc configuration file resides in $MAS_DIRECTORY and use the
-w option; for example, adapting the above example
to retrieve data from yahoo.com results in:
%par
mas -o -f , -w -b 13579 &
%par
Once you have started the server, you can start a GUI client from the
command line by changing the current directory to:
%par
@linux{mas_dir}/lib/classes
@windows{mas_dir}\lib\classes
%par
and entering the command:
%par
jre MA_Client hostname port_number
%par
where hostname stands for the network name of the computer the server is
running on and port_number is the socket port number the server is using
(13579 in the example above).
@begin:linux
(You can find out your machine's host name
with the hostname command or from the HOSTNAME environment variable -
i.e., echo $HOSTNAME.)
@end:linux
Note that since the GUI is a Java program,
you will need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on
your system.  The JRE is available for free for most operating systems.
@begin:linux
See the file java_info for information on obtaining the JRE for your
system.
@end:linux
(If you have the Java Development Kit installed, you can replace
jre with java in the above command, if you like.)
%par
@begin:linux
On UNIX systems, you can start a java GUI client by running the magc
command.  For example:
%par
magc 13579
%par
will start the GUI and connect with the server at port 13579.  If the
server is running on a different machine from the client, you can specify
the machine's network address with the -h option.  For example:
%par
magc -h boston.com 13579
%par
when the server is running on a machine named boston.com.
@end:linux
%par
See the file GUI_introduction for more information on running the GUI client.
%par
You can also run the server on intraday data.  One intraday data file
is included in
@linux{mas_dir}/lib/data/tradables:
@windows{mas_dir}\lib\data:
ibm.5-minute, 5-minute data for IBM.
(Note that this is artificial - made-up - data, since real intraday data
is expensive.)  You can run the server on the daily and intraday data
for IBM with:
%par
mas -o -f , 2425 -b -d txt -i 5-minute ibm.* &
%par
Then start the GUI the same way as before.

%hdg2Mas Server Command-line Options
The -h option to mas will give a full listing of the command-line options.
%par
#Need to also cover other tricky options, such as -i/-d.
The format of the date-specification option, used to
configure the server to read the
date field of its data in formats other than the default yyyymmdd, is:
%par
*^fontI-date-spec:&lt;spec&gt;*^fontP
%par
The actual specification
(the &lt;spec&gt; part of the option)
is of the form:
%par
&lt;key1&gt;=&lt;value1&gt;[,&lt;key2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;,...]
%par
where &lt;key#&gt; is one of:
*^fontIdate-format*^fontP, *^fontIyear-partition*^fontP,
or *^fontIdate-sep*^fontP.
For the *^fontIdate-format*^fontP specification, the &lt;value#&gt;
part gives the year/month/day format of the date in the input data
(using the '#' character to separate the date components).
For example:
%par
*^fontIdate-format=yyyy#mm#dd*^fontP &nbsp;specifies the order:
year, month, day.
%par
*^fontIdate-format=mm#dd#yyyy*^fontP &nbsp;specifies the order:
month, day, year.
%par
*^fontIdate-format=dd#mm#yy*^fontP &nbsp;specifies the order:
day, month, year, with a two-digit year.
%par
*^fontIdate-format=dd#month3#yy*^fontP &nbsp;specifies day, month, year,
with a two-digit year and with a three-letter abbreviated month
(Jan, Feb, etc.).
%par
The *^fontIdate-sep*^fontP specification gives the field separator to use
for the date.
And the *^fontIyear-partition*^fontP specification gives the partition value
for two-digit years: If the year is greater than this value, the year is
interpreted as a year in the 1900s and if the year is less than or equal
to this value, the year is interpreted as a year in the 2000s.
%par
Here's a complete example:
%par
-date-spec:date-format=dd#month3#yy,year-partition=80,date-sep=-
%par
This example specifies a date of the form *^fontIdd-Mon-yy*^fontP
(a three-letter
abbreviated month with a two-digit year), with 80 as the partition value.
Thus the date
*^fontI10-Jan-03*^fontP is interpreted as January 10, 2003 and the
date *^fontI21-Oct-81*^fontP is interpreted as October 21, 1981.

@begin:linux
%hdg2Using MAS with a Database Management System on Linux

If you have a DBMS with ODBC support, you may be able to store your data in
a database and have MAS obtain its market data from there instead of from
files.  I have MAS set up on my system to talk to a Postgres database using
%start_anchor
%url_labelunixODBCshow
%url_suffix,show
%url_addrhttp://www.unixodbc.org/show
%end_anchor
a package for Linux and UNIX systems.
%par
To configure MAS to connect to a database, you will first need to
create a database and the necessary tables to store market data.
(I have included some scripts I use to create tables in the scripts
package
@linux(in the src/scripts/database/postgres directory),
@windows(in the src\scripts\database\postgres directory),
which you
can use for suggestions as to needed table structures, if you wish.)
And you will need to make sure that your ODBC libraries and drivers are
installed and a data source name configured for the MAS database.
%par
Once the database is created and ODBC configured properly, you will need
to create a database configuration file for MAS.  The default name for
this file is mas_dbrc.  This file will need to reside in the directory
specified by the MAS_DIRECTORY environment variable.
%par
The mas_dbrc file contains settings that tell MAS how to query for the
data it needs.  For example, it tells MAS the name of the table in
which daily stock data is stored.
%par
I have included the mas_dbrc file I use on my system in the MAS package.
You will find it in the lib directory.  The file is commented and,
hopefully, you will be able to figure out from the settings and
comments in the file how to set it up for your particular system
configuration.
%par
Once you have everything set up properly, you can start MAS and use the -p
option to tell it to use the database for its data.
@end:linux


%hdg2Using MAS with the QuoteMonster Script
%par
You can configure MAS to use the popular
%start_anchor
%url_labelQuoteMonstershow
%url_addrhttp://xmlworks.com/quotemonster/
%end_anchor
perl script to
obtain its stock data from yahoo.com's free historical stock data service.
To do this, you will first need to download the
%start_anchor
%url_labelQuoteMonstershow
%url_addrhttp://xmlworks.com/quotemonster/show
%end_anchor
script.
%par
After downloading QuoteMonster, follow the instructions for installation
in the readme file.  (You will need to obtain the Perl interpreter
if it is not already on your system *^em if you type "perl -v" at the
command line and get a response back like: "This is perl, version
5.00X" ..., then you have perl installed.)  Once QuoteMonster is
installed, make sure the script (which is named qm) is in your path.
(If you type "type qm", you should get a result something like: "qm
is /usr/local/bin/qm".  If you get an error message instead, it is not
in your path.  If you're not sure how to change your path variable,
%start_anchor
%url_labelhttp://sunsite.dk/linux-newbie/FAQ2.htm#PATH_changeshow
%url_addrhttp://sunsite.dk/linux-newbie/FAQ2.htm#PATH_change
%end_anchor
gives a pretty good
descriptionn of how to do this.)
%par
After installing QuoteMonster, you will need to make sure that the wrapper
script that calls QuoteMonster, named mas_external_retrieve.pl, resides
in the directory specified by the MAS_DIRECTORY environment variable.
(See the file env_settings for information about the MAS_DIRECTORY
environment variable.)  The mas_external_retrieve.pl file is installed
in /masdir/lib (where /masdir stands for the parent directory into which
you installed MAS).
%par
After making sure mas_external_retrieve.pl is in your MAS_DIRECTORY,
you will need to create a symbols.mas file, which also needs to reside
in the directory specified by the MAS_DIRECTORY variable.  This file
holds all the stock symbols that you want to be available to MAS, one
symbol per line.  You can simply use a text editor (such as vi, emacs,
or pico, etc.) to enter the symbols for the stocks you wish to analyze
(either upper or lower-case is fine).  Or you can copy the list of
symbols from another file, as long as you make sure that the result in
symbols.mas has one symbol per line and has no other garbage in it.
(There is a sample symbols.mas file in /masdir/lib/data.)
%par
At this point, you should be able to start MAS using the external
data retrieval mechanism hooked to QuoteMonster with the command:
%par
mas -o -x -b 2345 &
%par
(The -o tells MAS that the data includes an "open" field; -x tells MAS
to use the external-data-retrieval mechanism; -b tells MAS it is being
run in the background; and 2345 is the port number to be used by the
GUI and command-line clients to communicate with the MAS server.)
%par
There are some settings within the mas_external_retrieve.pl script that
can be changed to alter settings such as how many years worth of data
to obtain.  See the documentation (comments) in the script for instructions
on what settings can be changed and what they are for.

%hdg2Notes

[1] For those not familiar with technical analysis, it is a set of
techniques for analyzing market data, using indicators such as trend
lines, moving averages, price momentum, oscillators, etc. to identify
changes in market trends.  It is based on the observation that "prices
move in trends which are determined by the changing attitudes of investors
toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological
forces." ["Technical Analysis Explained," by Martin J. Pring]
%par
[2] For example, one configuration I have used is to issue a buy signal
if Stochastic %D crosses below 35% (indicating that the stock is becoming
oversold) and, no more than 28 days before that, the weekly MACD difference
line crossed above the weekly MACD signal line (indicating that the stock
may be in a long-term uptrend), as well as to issue a sell signal for the
opposite event - Stochastic %D crosses above 65% and weekly MACD difference
line crosses below weekly MACD signal line.
