Here are some other examples of creating market analyzers.


Example A:  Daily Volume >= 1,000,000

Choose simple as the analyzer type and "one" for the number of indicators.
Choose "Market Data" as the indicator.  Choose GE_OPERATOR as the root
operator.  Choose VOLUME for GE_OPERATOR's left operand and choose
CONSTANT for GE_OPERATOR's right operand.  For the CONTANT's value, enter
1000000 - or if you would like to use a different value than 1 million,
enter that.  Choose daily for the trading period type.  Finally, choose
a good name.


Example B:  Volume > yesterday's Volume EMA (5) * 2.75 AND
Daily Volume >= 1,000,000

Choose compound as the analyzer type.  Choose the volume spike detector
that was created in the Volume Spike Detector example from
creating_market_analyzers as the left analyzer.  Choose the "Daily Volume
>= 1,000,000" analyzer from the above example for the right analyzer.
Say "no" to adding time extensions before and after the left/right analyzers.
Say "no" to specifying an event type as target for the left analyzer's
date/time.  Choose a good name for the analyzer.

Example C: Slope of MACD Signal Crosses Above 0

This is a signal to detect a long-term uptrend using weekly data.

Select Simple as the analyzer type.  It will use two technical indicators.
The left indicator should be "Slope of MACD Signal line".  (See "Example 6:
Slope of MACD Signal Line", from creating_indicators.)  The right indicator
should be "Line".  The starting y-value for the line should be 0 and the
slope should be 0.

The trading period type should be weekly.  Specification for crossover
detection should be "below-to-above".  It should not have an operator.
A good name for the analyzer is: "Slope of MACD Signal Line Cross
Above 0 (Buy)".

For a similar indicator to detect a downtrend, when the MACD Signal Line
crosses below 0, follow the above steps, but choose "above-to-below" for
the crossover detection.
