            Introduction to the Market Analysis Library


The Market Analysis Library (MAL) provides functionality enabling the
creation of technical analysis applications.  Examples of typical
applications that would use the library include charting programs (such
as the well-known commercial program MetaStock) and technical analysis
engines that can be run periodically to generate buy and sell signals.
(For example, on a UNIX system, a cron job could be scheduled to run every
night to process current market data and send email to the user listing
each market for which a buy or sell signal is generated, according to
specifications set by the user.)

One of the main goals of the MAL is to provide a flexible mechanism that
developers can use to create powerful, high quality technical analysis
applications, such as the two examples above, with minimal effort.
This goal will be accomplished by fulfilling the following requirements:

    - Provide an object-oriented framework that can be used via the
      client relation as well as via inheritance.

    - Provide, by means of its status as free software, the ability for
      developers to add to and change the library itself to fulfill
      their particular requirements.

    - Provide a mechanism that allows technical analysis indicators to be
      created on the fly by end users and added to a TA indicator
      "library," as well as allowing the end user to specify "events"
      (such as price dropping below the moving average) that generate
      buy and sell signals.

The last requirement is not yet addressed in the design, although a good
part of the basic framework for it is in place.  A parsing mechanism still
needs to be designed to allow the user to use a language to specify new
indicators and event specifications.

For those not familiar with it, technical analysis is a set of techniques
for analyzing market data, using indicators such as trend lines,
moving averages, price momentum, oscillators, etc. to identify changes
in market trends.  It is based on the observation that "prices move
in trends which are determined by the changing attitudes of investors
toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological
forces." ["Technical Analysis Explained," by Martin J. Pring]

For those interested in looking further into the subject of technical
analysis, I would recommend the book quoted from above, as well as
"Trading for a Living," by Dr. Alexander Elder.
