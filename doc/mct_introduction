%hdg1Introduction to the MAS Control Terminalhide
The MAS Control Terminal (MCT) is an application used to manage the different
components of the Market Analysis System (MAS).  This document
describes the management features of the MCT, most of which manifest
in the MCT Graphical User Interface (GUI) as labeled buttons.

%hdg2Start a MAS session
Starting a MAS session consists of starting up the MAS server and bringing up
a MAS session control window to manage that session.  The window allows
management of actions related to the session, including starting the
charting application, invoking the command-line client, and terminating
the session.  Below are descriptions of the features available for
managing a session.
%hdg3Start charts
This feature starts up the charting application, allowing viewing of
stock and futures charts, as well as charting of technical indicators.
%hdg3Start command-line client
This feature invokes the MAS command-line client, a command-line-based
application that provides access to advanced features of the server,
including creating and editing technical indicators and trading-signal
generation criteria, as well as applying these criteria to generate
trading signals.
%hdg3Terminate Session
This feature terminates the session by telling the MAS server to shut
itself down.
%hdg2Connect to a running MAS session
This feature allows connecting to a running MAS server that is not
currently under management of the MCT.  If the connection succeeds, it
brings up a session window for the adopted server process.  The connection
attempt may fail for various reaons, including if an invalid or incorrect
host name or port number is entered, if the server is not accepting
connections at the specified port number, etc.
%hdg2Terminating a MAS Session
This feature allows terminating a running MAS server that is not
currently under management of the MCT.
%hdg2Quit
The Quit button and the Quit menu option (under the File menu) shuts
down the MCT, terminating all MAS sessions under control of the MCT.
(!!!Doc. Note: Whether the MAS sessions are terminated may be configurable
in the future.)
%hdg2Quit without terminating sessions
This menu option (under the File menu) shuts down the MCT without
terminating the managed sessions - that is, all sessions will remain
running after the MCT exits.
%hdg2Server startup configuration
This menu option (under the Edit menu) pops up a list-selection window
that allows the selection of how the server is to be run.  By default,
the options available allow running the server such that either it gets
its data from files, from a database (using an ODBC connection), or
from the web.
