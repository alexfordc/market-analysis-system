<h1>
Technical Analysis Software for Windows and Linux
</h1>
<p>
The Market Analysis System (MAS) is an open-source software application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets using technical analysis.
MAS provides facilities for stock charting and futures charting,
including price, volume, and
a wide range of technical analysis indicators.
MAS also allows automated processing of market data - applying technical
analysis indicators with user-selected criteria
to market data to automatically generate trading signals -
and can be used as the main component of a sophisticated trading system.
Some of the features of MAS are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Includes basic technical analysis indicators, such as
Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, Stochastic, MACD,
RSI, On Balance Volume, and Momentum.
<li>
Includes more advanced indicators, such as Standard Deviation,
Slope of EMA of Volume, Slope of MACD Signal Line,
Bollinger Bands, and Parabolic SAR.
<li>
User can create new technical analysis indicators,
including complex indicators based on existing
indicators.
<li>
User can configure criteria for automated trading-signal
generation.
<li>
Creation of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly data from daily data.
<li>
Handles intraday data.
<li>
Handles stock and futures data.
<li>
Accepts input data from files, from a database, or from
the web.
(Includes a configuration for obtaining end-of-day data from yahoo.com.)
<li>
Can be configured and run as a server that provides services for several
clients at a time running on remote machines.
</ul>
<p>
The current version of MAS runs on Intel machines, on both the Linux and
Windows operating systems.
(The Windows port is official as of release 1.6.5.)
<p>
MAS is free software (freeware).

<h2>
Uses of MAS
</h2>
MAS is a flexible system that can be used either as a personal
tool&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;an important component in one's trading system,
as described above&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;or,
making full use of its client/server architecture, it can be installed on
a powerful server and configured to serve many clients at the same time.
For example, several users can connect to the server at the same time
to view stock charts with the GUI client; or MAS can be set up to run
market analysis periodically on all stocks in the database and to send
buy and sell signals resulting from the analysis to all users who have
subscribed to this service.
