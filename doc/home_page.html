Uses of MAS
</h2>
<p>
MAS is a flexible system that can be used either as a personal
tool&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;an important component in one's trading system,
as described above&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;or,
making full use of its client/server architecture, it can be installed on
a powerful server and configured to serve many clients at the same time.
</p>
<p>
For example, several users can connect to the server at the same time
to view stock charts with the GUI client; or MAS can be set up to run
market analysis periodically on all stocks in the database and to send
buy and sell signals resulting from the analysis to all users who have
subscribed to this service.
