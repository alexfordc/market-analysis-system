The Market Analysis System (MAS) is an open-source software application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets using technical analysis.
</p>
<p>
MAS provides facilities for stock charting and futures charting,
including price, volume, and
a wide range of technical analysis indicators.
MAS also allows automated processing of market data &#8212; applying technical
analysis indicators with user-selected criteria
to market data to automatically generate trading signals &#8212;
and can be used as the main component of a sophisticated trading system.

Uses of MAS
</h2>
<p>
MAS is a flexible system that can be used either as a personal
tool&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;an important component in one's trading system,
as described above&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;or,
making full use of its client/server architecture, it can be installed on
a powerful server and configured to serve many clients at the same time.
</p>
<p>
For example, several users can connect to the server at the same time
to view stock charts with the GUI client; or MAS can be set up to run
market analysis periodically on all stocks in the database and to send
buy and sell signals resulting from the analysis to all users who have
subscribed to this service.
</p>
<h2 id="uses">
Disclaimer
</h2>
MAS is a powerful tool that, when used well, can
save time, as well as help to increase one's profits.
However, MAS is only a tool and cannot make your trading decisions for you.
Trading successfully requires great discipline and requires one to take
responsibility for one's decisions.
