Environment variable settings for MAS

The following environment variables should be set to run the market analysis
server:

MAS_MAILER
MAS_DIRECTORY
MAS_STOCK_SPLIT_FILE
MAS_MAILER_SUBJECT_FLAG

MAS_MAILER specifies the email client that will be used by MAS.  If this
variable is not set, a default of "elm" will be used.

MAS_MAILER_SUBJECT_FLAG specifies the command-line flag used by the mailer
to specify that the next argument is the email message subject.  If this
variable is not set, a default of "-s" will be used.

MAS_STOCK_SPLIT_FILE specifies the name of a file containing stock split
information.  If this variable is not set, a default of "ma_stock_splits"
will be used.

MAS_DIRECTORY specifies the directory MAS will look in for its configuration
files, such as user-defined indicators and the stock split file.  If
this variable is not set, MAS will look in the current directory for this
information.

IMPORTANT:  To use the current configuration of indicators and rules for
event generation, you will need to copy the following files from the MAS
lib directory (../lib) to $MAS_DIRECTORY:

generators_persist
indicators_persist

MAS will run correctly without these files, but you will be missing some
functionality - technical indicators and event generation rules - if you
run MAS without these files.
