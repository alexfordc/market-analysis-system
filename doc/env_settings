Environment variables and configuration files for MAS

The market analysis server uses the following environment variables:

MAS_MAILER
MAS_DIRECTORY
MAS_STOCK_SPLIT_FILE
MAS_MAILER_SUBJECT_FLAG

[NOTE: Don't forget to export these variables in your shell (or use setenv
if you're using a csh-like shell).]

MAS_MAILER specifies the email client that will be used by MAS.  If this
variable is not set, a default of "elm" will be used.

MAS_MAILER_SUBJECT_FLAG specifies the command-line flag used by the mailer
to specify that the next argument is the email message subject.  If this
variable is not set, a default of "-s" will be used.

MAS_STOCK_SPLIT_FILE specifies the name of a file containing stock split
information.  If this variable is not set, a default of "mas_stock_splits"
will be used.

MAS_DB_CONFIG_FILE specifies the name of a file containing database
configuration information.  If this variable is not set, a default of
"mas_dbrc" will be used.

MAS_DIRECTORY specifies the directory MAS will look in for its configuration
files, such as user-defined indicators, the stock split file, and the
database configuration file.  If this variable is not set, MAS will look in
the current directory for this information.

Also, in order to use macl, the MAS command-line client, you will need to
have Python installed and will need to change the PYTHONPATH environment
varialbe to include the directory where the python library files used by the
macl script are stored.  If you performed a normal installation, these
files should reside in a sub-directory named "python", under the "lib"
directory in which you chose to install the library files.  For example,
if your home directory is /home/joe and you chose to put the lib directory
under your home directory, the python directory will be /home/joe/lib/python.

MAS uses the following files to store market analysis objects such as
technical indicators:

indicators_persist - used to store technical indicators
generators_persist - used to store market analyzers
registrants_persist - used to store registrants of market analysis events

IMPORTANT:  To use the current configuration of indicators and rules for
event generation, you will need to copy the files generators_persist and
indicators_persist from the MAS lib directory (../lib) to $MAS_DIRECTORY:
MAS will run correctly without these files, but you will be missing some
functionality - technical indicators and event generation rules - if you
run MAS without these files.

MAS also creates a history file for each market event registrant created
by the user.  This file will be named according to a convention that
begins with the email address of the registrant, followed by ".history",
followed by a number.  For example, for an email address of "jude" a history
file might be named: "jude.history1060754277".  These files are used to
store the history of events previously generated to prevent sending of
duplicate signals that were generated on a previous run.  You might want
to back up these files regularly in case they get inadvertantly deleted.
