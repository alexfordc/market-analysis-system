This is an informal release of some scripts I have written to help automate
the use of MAS.  I'm releasing them because I think others may find these
scripts useful.  Since these scripts are not part of the formal release and
are written specifically to work with my setup, if you use them you will
probably need to modify most of them to work with your particular setup.
In other words, no guarantees that they will work for you, but they may save
you some time if you're willing and able to do some hacking on them.
