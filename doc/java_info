Information on obtaining the Java Runtime Environment for your System

You will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - version 1.1.7 or
higher - to run the Market Analysis GUI Client.  You can obtain a version of
the JRE for Solaris and for Windows at (version 1.2):

(version 1.1):

http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html

Either version will probably work equally well.  Although I have not tried
them, so I can't guarantee this.

You can obtain a version for Linux at:

http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html

You can obtain a version for the Macintosh at:

http://www.apple.com/java/

Links to JREs (or JDKs) for other operating systems can be found at:
http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi


Note: If you want to develop Java programs, you can obtain the Java
Development Kit instead, which includes the JRE; but if you're a developer,
you probably already know this.
