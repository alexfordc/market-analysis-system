Information on obtaining the Java Runtime Environment for your System

You will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - version 1.1.7 or
higher - to run the Market Analysis GUI Client.  You can obtain a version of
the JRE for Linux, Solaris, or Windows at (version 1.2):

You can obtain version 1.1 for Solaris or Windows at:

http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html

Either version will probably work equally well.  Although I have not tried
them, so I can't guarantee this.

You might be able to find version 1.1 of the JRE for Linux at (I didn't find
it in a quick search, but it's probably there somewhere):

You can obtain a version for the Macintosh at:

http://www.apple.com/java/

Links to JREs (or JDKs) for other operating systems can be found at:
http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi

If you notice that the GUI is a little sluggish, you might want to try
IBM's JRE, which includes a just-in-time compiler.  I've noticed about
a 50% increase in the GUI's performance with this JRE.  It's available
for free (as of 1/18/2001) at:

http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/download/

Note: If you want to develop Java programs, you can obtain the Java
Development Kit instead, which includes the JRE; but if you're a developer,
you probably already know this.
