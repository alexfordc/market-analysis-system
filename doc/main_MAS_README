The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a client/server application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets, with the goal of
helping its user make better buying and selling decisions and to help
save time by automating some tasks that would otherwise be done by hand.

The two main components of MAS are the Market Analysis System Server (also
known as Market Analysis Server) and the Market Analysis GUI Client.

The MAS installation includes the following directories:

    bin - All executable files and shell scripts needed for running MAS

    lib - Java class files and other library files needed by MAS

    doc - Documentation of MAS features and how to use MAS

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to install MAS.
