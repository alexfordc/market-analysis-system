INTRODUCTION

The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a software application that provides
tools for analysis of financial markets using technical analysis. MAS
provides facilities for stock charting, including price, volume, and a
wide range of technical analysis indicators. MAS also allows automated
processing of market data - applying technical analysis indicators with
user-selected criteria to market data to automatically generate trading
signals - and can be used as the main component of a sophisticated
trading system. Some of the features of MAS are:

   - Exponential Moving Average, Stochastic, MACD, RSI, On Balance Volume,
     Momentum, Rate of Change, etc.
   - User can create new technical analysis indicators.
   - User can configure simple and complex criteria for automated signal
     generation.
   - Creation of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly data from daily data.
   - Handles intraday data.
   - Can be configured and run as a server that provides services for
     several clients at a time running on remote machines.


REPORTING MAS SYSTEM INFORMATION

Once you have successfully installed MAS and gotten it to run correctly,
I would appreciate it if you would run the mas_dir/lib/report_system_info
script (where mas_dir stands for the parent directory into which you
installed MAS), which will gather some information about your system
and email it to me.  This script will determine what version of MAS
you are using, the version of Linux you are running (uname -a), get cpu
information from /proc/cpuinfo, and ask you what desktop environment and
version you are using and email this information to me.  If you don't
like the idea of a script obtaining this information automatically,
you can, alternatively, simply gather the information yourself by saving
the output of "/path_of_mas_executable/mas -v", "uname -a", and "cat
/proc/cpuinfo" into a file; include the name and version number of the
deskstop environment (such as KDE 1.1.2) you are running; and send this
file to me at: jtc@dimensional.com.  I will use this information to
keep a record of what systems MAS has successfully been run on; your name
and email address will not be included in this record.


DOWNLOADING THE CURRENT VERSION OF MAS

As of July, 2000, the current version of MAS can be downloaded from:
http://eiffel-mas.sourceforge.net/


MAIN DIRECTORIES IN THE MAS INSTALLATION

The two main components of MAS are the Market Analysis System Server (also
known as Market Analysis Server) and the Market Analysis GUI Client.

The MAS installation includes the following directories:

    bin - All executable files and shell scripts needed for running MAS

    lib - Java class files and other library files needed by MAS

    doc - Documentation of MAS features and how to use MAS

The bin directory has the following executable files:

    macl - MA command-line client - connects to the server over the network
	       and uses its command-line interface - implemented in Python

    maclj - MA command-line client - wapper script for Java implementation

    magc - MA GUI Client - wrapper script for Java GUI client

    mas - Market Analysis Server

    mas_assert - Market Analysis Server with assertions

If you encounter a fatal error with mas, running mas_assert under the same
conditions may give extra useful information to help pinpoint the problem.
If you do this, please capture the results and email them to me at my
email address at the end of this file.

The lib directory contains two subdirectories: classes, which contains
the Java class files needed by the GUI client; and data, which contains
some sample data files.


MAS DATA FILES AND FORMAT

Since the current version of MAS expects to obtain its data from a set
of data files - one for each market - you will need to obtain files with
historic data for the markets you are interested in tracking; and you
will need some method of updating these files each trading day with the
current end-of-day data.  (If you don't currently have a good data source,
I have found http://www.msodata.com/ to be a reliable, cheap source of daily
market data.)

Currently MAS handles data with the fields date, open, high, low, close,
volume (in that order), which provides for stock and index data (with
volume of 0).  It expects the date field to follow the format:  yyyymmdd.
For example, 19990701, for July 1, 1999.  Future versions should handle
more fields, such as open interest.

There are some sample data files included in the correct format in lib/data
so that you can try out MAS without having to obtain data files.


RUNNING MAS

MAS is intended to be run as a server, servicing requests via a socket.
To do this, you will need to start the mas executable from the command
line, giving it the port number you wish to use for the socket connection,
as well as a list of market data files for it to process.  (You can give
it any port number above 1023.)  You can then start one or more client
programs to use mas's services.  See the file masystem_introduction,
in the doc directory, for more information on how to start the server
and the client.

To access the MAS functionality for creating new indicators or new event
generators, you can either run mas at a terminal and use its command-line
interface directly or you can run the macl (if you have Python installed)
or the maclj script.

CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have problems or questions about MAS or want to give feedback or
suggestions (requests for new features, etc.), you are welcome to email
me at:

jtc@dimensional.com

I will try my best to respond promptly.  If you do email me about a
problem, please include as much background information as possible with
your email, including, if possible, a precise description of what you
were doing when the problem occurred.

Also, if you are running MAS on a Linux system I would appreciate a short
email letting me know what version of MAS you are running and what Linux
distribution and version you are running it on, and whether or not MAS
installed and runs properly on that distribution.  I will use this
information to compile a list of Linux distributions on which MAS has
been know to run successfully.
