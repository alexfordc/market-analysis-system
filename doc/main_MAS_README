General Introduction and Usage Instructions

%hdg1Introduction

The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a software application that provides
tools for analysis of financial markets using technical analysis.
MAS provides facilities for charting of stock and futures data,
including price, volume, and a
wide range of technical analysis indicators.
MAS also allows automated
processing of market data - applying technical analysis indicators with
user-selected criteria to market data to automatically generate trading
signals - and can be used as the main component of a sophisticated
trading system.
Some of the features of MAS are:

%startlist
%listitem
Exponential Moving Average, Stochastic, MACD, RSI, On Balance Volume,
Momentum, Rate of Change, etc.
%listitem
Users can create new technical analysis indicators.
%listitem
Users can configure criteria for automated signal
generation.
%listitem
Creation of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly data from daily data.
%listitem
Handles intraday data.
%listitem
Can be configured and run as a server that provides services for
several clients at a time running on remote machines.

%hdg1Reporting MAS System Information

Once you have successfully installed MAS and gotten it to run correctly,
I would appreciate it if you would run the mas_dir/lib/report_system_info
script (where mas_dir stands for the parent directory into which you
installed MAS), which will gather some information about your system
and email it to me.  This script will determine what version of MAS
you are using, the version of Linux you are running (uname -a), get
cpu information from /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/meminfo, and ask you what
desktop environment and version you are using and email this information
to me.  If you don't like the idea of a script obtaining this information
automatically, you can, alternatively, simply gather the information
yourself by saving the output of "/path_of_mas_executable/mas -v",
"uname -a", "cat /proc/cpuinfo", and "cat /proc/meminfo" into a file;
include the name of the Linux distribution you are running and the name
and version number of the deskstop environment (such as KDE 1.1.2)
you are running; and send this file to me at: jtc@dimensional.com.
(Make sure you include mas or MAS in the subject line to get past my
spam filter.)  I will use this information to keep a record of what
systems MAS has successfully been run on; your name and email address
will not be included in this record.

%hdg1Feedback
I am interested in hearing your comments and criticisms of the MAS package.
Some improvements have been made in this release with respect to how
the program is started - mainly, using a "control terminal" so that only
one desktop icon is needed (as opposed to four icons in the previous
version) and for more integrated access to the different components
of the system.
However, there is still more work to do to make the system easier to use.
Your criticisms and suggestions will help me to determine what areas
need improvement.

%hdg1Support for MAS
Additionally, if you have a problem installing MAS or getting it to work the
way you would like, please first look over the documentation, including the
%start_url
%url_labelFAQshow
%url_addrhttp://eiffel-mas.sourceforge.net/support/FAQ.html
%url_suffix,show
%end_url
to see if you can find a solution.
If you're not able to find a solution, you are welcome to send me an email
describing the problem you are having.
I do not have a lot of time these days and am looking into the possibility
of charging for technical support (since paid time makes the time spent
more justifiable).
However, if it's a simple problem, I may be able to help you without charge.
%par
If you do report a problem via email, please include as much background
information as possible with your email, including, if possible, a
precise description of what you were doing when the problem occurred.
This will increase the chances that I have enough information to figure
out what is going wrong and thus that I will be
able to help you fix the problem.
You will find my email address at the end of this document.

%hdg1Downloading the Current Version of MAS

As of January, 2004, the current version of MAS can be downloaded from:

%url_addrhttp://eiffel-mas.sourceforge.net/

%hdg1Main Directories in the MAS Installation

The two main components of MAS are the Market Analysis System Server (also
known as Market Analysis Server) and the Market Analysis GUI Client.
%par
The MAS installation includes the following directories:

%startlist
%listitem
bin - All executable files and shell scripts needed for running MAS
%listitem
lib - Java class files and other library files needed by MAS
%listitem
doc - Documentation of MAS features and how to use MAS
%endlist

@begin:linux
The bin directory has the following executable files:

%startlist
%listitem
macl - Market Analysis Command-Line client - connects to the server over
the network and uses its command-line interface - implemented in Python
%listitem
maclj - Market Analysis Command-Line client - wapper script for Java
implementation
%listitem
magc - MA GUI Client - wrapper script for Java GUI client
%listitem
mas - Market Analysis Server
%listitem
mas_assert - Market Analysis Server with assertions
%endlist

If you encounter a fatal error with mas, running mas_assert under the same
conditions may give extra useful information to help pinpoint the problem.
If you do this, please capture the results and email them to me at my
email address at the end of this file.
%par
@end:linux

The lib directory contains two subdirectories: classes, which contains
the Java class files needed by the GUI client; and data, which contains
some sample data files.

%hdg1MAS Data Files and Format

@windows*^fontBNote:*^fontP If you have configured the system to get its
@windowsdata from the web, you can ignore this section.
@windows%par
When the MAS server is run such that its data is obtained from files,
you will need to obtain one file with
historic data for each tradable you are interested in tracking; and you
will need some method of updating these files each trading day with the
current end-of-day data.
(Note: See the file masystem_introduction for
directions on how to run MAS with alternative data sources.)
%par
Currently MAS handles data with the fields date, open, high, low, close,
volume, and, optionally, open interest (in that order), which provides
for stock and index data (with volume of 0), as well as futures data.
It expects the date field to follow the format:  yyyymmdd.  For example,
19990701, for July 1, 1999.
%par
There are some sample data files included in the correct format in
@linuxlib/data/tradables
@windowslib\data
so that you can try out MAS without having to obtain data files.

%hdg1Accessing the Advanced Features of MAS

If you need more control over how the server is started, or other aspects
of the system, you can bypass the MCT and start the server from the command
line.
See the file masystem_introduction, in the doc directory, for more information
on how to start the server and the client programs from the command line.
%par
@begin:linux
To access the MAS functionality for creating new indicators or new event
generators, you can either run MAS at a terminal and use its command-line
interface directly or you can run the macl (if you have Python installed)
or the maclj script.
@end:linux
@begin:windows
To access the MAS functionality for creating new indicators or new event
generators, you can use the command-line interface to the server by
clicking on the "Start command-line client" button in the MAS session
window.
