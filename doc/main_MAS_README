INTRODUCTION

The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a client/server application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets, with the goal of
helping its user make better buying and selling decisions and to help
save time by automating some tasks that would otherwise be done by hand.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to install MAS.


MAIN DIRECTORIES IN THE MAS INSTALLATION

The two main components of MAS are the Market Analysis System Server (also
known as Market Analysis Server) and the Market Analysis GUI Client.

The MAS installation includes the following directories:

    bin - All executable files and shell scripts needed for running MAS

    lib - Java class files and other library files needed by MAS

    doc - Documentation of MAS features and how to use MAS

The bin directory has the following executable files:

    macl - MA command-line client - connects to the server over the network
	       and uses its command-line interface - implemented in Python

    maclj - MA command-line client - wapper script for Java implementation

    magc - MA GUI Client - wrapper script for Java GUI client

    mas - Market Analysis Server

    mas_assert - Market Analysis Server with assertions

If you encounter a fatal error with mas, running mas_assert under the same
conditions may give extra useful information to help pinpoint the problem.
If you do this, please capture the results and email them to me at my
email address at the end of this file.


MAS DATA FILES AND FORMAT

Since the current version of MAS expects to obtain its data from a set
of data files - one for each market - you will need to obtain files with
historic data for the markets you are interested in tracking; and you
will need some method of updating these files each trading day with the
current end-of-day data.  (If you don't currently have a good data source,
http://www.msodata.com/ appears to be a reliable, cheap source of daily
market data.  They have a two-week free trial period, which I have taken
advantage of, and I am satisfied enough with their service that I have
decided to subscribe when the trial period ends.)

Currently MAS handles data with the fields date, open, high, low, close,
volume (in that order), which provides for stock and index data (with
volume of 0).  It expects the date field to follow the format:  yyyymmdd.
For example, 19990701, for July 1, 1999.  Future versions should handle
more fields, such as open interest, and time - for intraday data.


RUNNING MAS

MAS is intended to be run as a server, servicing requests via a socket.
To do this, you will need to start the mas executable from the command
line, giving it the port number you wish to use for the socket connection,
as well as a list of market data files for it to process.  (You can give
it any number above 1023.)  You can then start one or more client programs
to use mas's services.  See the file masystem_introduction, in the doc
directory, for more information on how to start the server and the client.

To access the MAS functionality for creating new indicators or new event
generators, you can either run mas at a terminal and use its command-line
interface directly or you can run the macl (if you have Python installed)
or the maclj script.


CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have problems or questions about MAS or want to give feedback or
suggestions (requests for new features, etc.), you are welcome to email
me at:

jtc@dimensional.com

I will try to respond promptly, though I can't guarantee a response,
being often busy.  If you do email me about a problem, please include
as much background information as possible with your email, including,
if possible, a precise description of what you were doing when the
problem occurred.
