General Introduction and Usage Instructions
%end_title
%hdg1Introduction

The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a software application that provides
tools for analysis of financial markets using technical analysis.
MAS provides facilities for charting of stock and futures data,
including price, volume, and a
wide range of technical analysis indicators.
MAS also allows automated
processing of market data - applying technical analysis indicators with
user-selected criteria to market data to automatically generate trading
signals - and can be used as the main component of a sophisticated
trading system.
Some of the features of MAS are:

%startlist
%listitem
Exponential Moving Average, Stochastic, MACD, RSI, On Balance Volume,
Momentum, Rate of Change, etc.
%listitem
Users can create new technical analysis indicators.
%listitem
Users can configure criteria for automated signal
generation.
%listitem
Creation of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly data from daily data.
%listitem
Handles intraday data.
%listitem
Can be configured and run as a server that provides services for
several clients at a time running on remote machines.

%hdg1Reporting MAS System Information

Once you have successfully installed MAS and gotten it to run correctly,
I would appreciate it if you would run the mas_dir/lib/report_system_info
script (where mas_dir stands for the parent directory into which you
installed MAS), which will gather some information about your system
and email it to me.  This script will determine what version of MAS
you are using, the version of Linux you are running (uname -a), get
cpu information from /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/meminfo, and ask you what
desktop environment and version you are using and email this information
to me.  If you don't like the idea of a script obtaining this information
automatically, you can, alternatively, simply gather the information
yourself by saving the output of "/path_of_mas_executable/mas -v",
"uname -a", "cat /proc/cpuinfo", and "cat /proc/meminfo" into a file;
include the name of the Linux distribution you are running and the name
and version number of the deskstop environment (such as KDE 1.1.2)
you are running; and send this file to me at: jtc@dimensional.com.
(Make sure you include mas or MAS in the subject line to get past my
spam filter.)  I will use this information to keep a record of what
systems MAS has successfully been run on; your name and email address
will not be included in this record.

%hdg1Feedback and Informal Support for MAS
I am interested in hearing your comments and criticisms of the MAS package.
This is an early release of MAS for Windows and, although I've put
some effort into making it easy to install and use, it still has a
ways to go.
Your criticisms and suggestions will help me to determine what areas
need improvement.
%par
Additionally, if you have a problem installing MAS or getting it to work
the way you would like, you are welcome to send me an email describing the
problem you are having.
If you do this, please include as much background information as
possible with your email, including, if possible, a precise description
of what you were doing when the problem occurred.
This will increase the chances that I have enough information to figure
out what is going wrong and thus that I will be
able to help you fix the problem.
Since there is no charge for this support at this time, I cannot guarantee
that I will be able to help with your problem, but I will try,
so it is probably worthwhile for you to contact me.
You will find my email address at the end of this document.

%hdg1Downloading the Current Version of MAS

As of October, 2002, the current version of MAS can be downloaded from:
%br
http://eiffel-mas.sourceforge.net/.

%hdg1Main Directories in the MAS Installation

The two main components of MAS are the Market Analysis System Server (also
known as Market Analysis Server) and the Market Analysis GUI Client.
%par
The MAS installation includes the following directories:

%startlist
%listitem
bin - All executable files and shell scripts needed for running MAS
%listitem
lib - Java class files and other library files needed by MAS
%listitem
doc - Documentation of MAS features and how to use MAS
%endlist

@begin:linux
The bin directory has the following executable files:

%startlist
%listitem
macl - MA command-line client - connects to the server over the network
and uses its command-line interface - implemented in Python
%listitem
maclj - MA command-line client - wapper script for Java implementation
%listitem
magc - MA GUI Client - wrapper script for Java GUI client
%listitem
mas - Market Analysis Server
%listitem
mas_assert - Market Analysis Server with assertions
%endlist

If you encounter a fatal error with mas, running mas_assert under the same
conditions may give extra useful information to help pinpoint the problem.
If you do this, please capture the results and email them to me at my
email address at the end of this file.
%par
@end:linux

The lib directory contains two subdirectories: classes, which contains
the Java class files needed by the GUI client; and data, which contains
some sample data files.

%hdg1MAS Data Files and Format

@windows\fBNote:\fP If you are using the "MAS Server (web)" icon to start
@windowsthe server, you can ignore this section.
@windows%par
When the MAS server is run such that its data is obtained from files,
you will need to obtain one file with
historic data for each tradable you are interested in tracking; and you
will need some method of updating these files each trading day with the
current end-of-day data.
(Note: See the file masystem_introduction for
directions on how to run MAS with alternative data sources.)
%par
Currently MAS handles data with the fields date, open, high, low, close,
volume, and, optionally, open interest (in that order), which provides
for stock and index data (with volume of 0), as well as futures data.
It expects the date field to follow the format:  yyyymmdd.  For example,
19990701, for July 1, 1999.
%par
There are some sample data files included in the correct format in lib/data
so that you can try out MAS without having to obtain data files.

%hdg1Running MAS

@begin:windows
\fBNote:\fP
If you are using the "MAS Server (web)" icon to start the server,
you can ignore this section.
%par
@end:windows
MAS is intended to be run as a server, servicing requests via a socket.
To do this, you will need to start the MAS executable from the command
line, giving it the port number you wish to use for the socket connection
(as well as a list of market data files for it to process, if you are
running the server in the mode where it obtains its data from files).
(You can give
it any port number above 1023.)  You can then start one or more client
programs to use MAS's services.  See the file masystem_introduction,
in the doc directory, for more information on how to start the server
and the client.
%par
@begin:linux
To access the MAS functionality for creating new indicators or new event
generators, you can either run MAS at a terminal and use its command-line
interface directly or you can run the macl (if you have Python installed)
or the maclj script.
@end:linux
@begin:windows
To access the MAS functionality for creating new indicators or new event
generators, you can use the command-line interface to the server by
double-clicking on the "MAS Command Line" icon, after
starting the server.
@end:windows
