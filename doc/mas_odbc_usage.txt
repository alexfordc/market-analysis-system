Using MAS with ODBC

For MAS to work with an ODBC driver
the file 'ms_dbsrvrc' must be present
in the same directory as mas.exe.

The file contains entries identifying
data source name, username, password,
the query for retrieving symbols from
the database, the query for retrieving
market data for a given symbol from the 
database and the name of the host variable
used in the market data query.

Each key-value pair must be separated by a tab
character.

Example:

data_source_name	my_db
user_id	demo
password	nosuchthing
markets	select symbol from Security where symbolclass = 14 order by symbol
market_data_query	select tradeDay, openVal, high, low, last, turnoverVol from tradehistory where tradehistory.symbol = :symbol order by tradeDay
market_data_host_var	symbol
