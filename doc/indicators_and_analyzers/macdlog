Customer:* what i'm trying to do is build an indicator
or analyser which compares todays macd histogram with yesterdays. I
thiought the easiest way to do it would be to get a simple tool which
simply returned yesterdays macdh then I can reuse this to chbuild
slightly more complex tools
MAS-support:* I see.

MAS-support:* What have you tried so far?
Customer:* the problem seems to be link the macdh with
the settable offset - they never quite show up together
Customer:* I have tried both indicators and analysers
but both seem to want a root operator
MAS-support:* OK.

MAS-support:* Let's try starting with a simple example and go
from there.
Customer:* ok

MAS-support:* Can you think of a signal you would like to
generate based on macd today and macd yesterday? -
MAS-support:* perhaps today was > yesterday?
Customer:* what i will eventually do is check for a
reversal but that sounds like a good starting point.
MAS-support:* OK - nice and simple, although it will give a lot
of signals, but that's OK.
Customer:* I will eventually link it to a more complex GT signal
MAS-support:* Yes, of course - once we get the simple example
working you can build from there.

...

MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* Now, It would be good to use the -r option to
record what you do - with macl.
MAS-support:* Have you used that before?
Customer:* no just found it and the input from file
which will be handy for automation
MAS-support:* OK - you can start it then with, something like:
MAS-support:* p=1234; macl $p -r /tmp/recfile
MAS-support:* where 1234 stands for the port # you're using.
...
MAS-support:* OK - you started macl?
Customer:* once i called it macl not mcal
MAS-support:* OK. - Did you start it with -r?
Customer:* yes
MAS-support:* OK. good.
Customer:* have an empty recfile in /tmp
MAS-support:* OK, let me start up a session.
MAS-support:* That's OK. It should have stuff in it when you exit.
MAS-support:* OK, are you ready to create an indicator?
Customer:* ready
MAS-support:* OK, so we said we want a signal when MACD today >
MACD yesterday ...
MAS-support:* Let me think for a minute...
MAS-support:* OK - I think there may be more than one way to do
this.
MAS-support:* Let's try putting most of the logic into the
indicator.
Customer:* thats probably best - hides the complexity a
bit
MAS-support:* I'm not sure - it may be best. It's the easiest
for me to think up on the fly at least.
MAS-support:* OK...
MAS-support:* Go into the edit indicators menu and create a new
indicator.
Customer:* ok
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* choose a new object.
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* then choose 2 - one-var. functn.
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* OK, give a name - just test1 or something short.
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* then select macd histogram as the input function.
Customer:* done
Customer:* this is the bit where I kept getting stuck
MAS-support:* OK, now we need an if/else condition.
MAS-support:* (I need to write a wizard to make this stuff
easier - it's hard right now.)
MAS-support:* Select NUMERIC_CONDITIONAL_COMMAND
Customer:* yes i think you need to be able to see and
edit the structure and also test it against some data once its built or
even during the build
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* (It's called BOOLEAN_NUMERIC_CLIENT in the old
version. sorry about the name change, but I think you'll agree it's a
better name.)
MAS-support:* OK now it should ask for the boolean op.
Customer:* do i use the c or e option ??
MAS-support:* You can use e if you want to name it....
MAS-support:* which can be useful - take your pick - c or e ...
Customer:* ill use c at the moment i can get onto the naming later
MAS-support:* OK...  Is it asking for the boolean operator?
Customer:* yes
MAS-support:* OK, now we want to know if today is > thanyesterday, so we need >
MAS-support:* the GT operator.
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* For the left operand, we need today, so choose
BASIC_NUMERIC_COMMAND -
MAS-support:* which should just extract the current value, whic is
MAS-support:* the current macd value.
MAS-support:* Let me know when you've entered the BNC.
...

MAS-support:* So is macl asking for GT operator's right operand?
Customer:* yes its asking for left operand
MAS-support:* left op - OK.
MAS-support:* So you need to give it BASIC_NUMERIC_COMMAND.
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* OK - the BNC will extract today's value from the MACD function.
MAS-support:* For the right operator, you want it to use yesterday's value.
MAS-support:* So give it SETTABLE_OFFSET_COMMAND.
Customer:* done
MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* BASIC_NUMERIC_COMMAND
MAS-support:* for SOCs oprand.
Customer:* ok done
MAS-support:* OK -by the way, you can use the same BNC as the
first one - that is , share it.
MAS-support:* Or you can use a new one.
MAS-support:* Doesn't matter with the BNC.
Customer:* ok - its asking for an indicator for SOC now
MAS-support:* OK, for SOC's input select macd histogram.
MAS-support:* (BTW, I think this question is not necessary and
should be removed - future release)
Customer:* done i suppose the answer to the no of days is 1 ???
MAS-support:* yes.
MAS-support:* OK, after that it will want the num. cond. cmds'
true command, right?
MAS-support:* Are you there yet?
Customer:* what number ( selection ) is that - its
given me 41 options ?
MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* It's asking for the true command?
Customer:* I dont have that option showing !!

Customer:* Soory yes i do !!
MAS-support:* You need a long window :)
MAS-support:* OK, so one way to do what we want is to set up the
MAS-support:* signal so that it interprets the value 1 as true.
MAS-support:* and 0 as false.
MAS-support:* So, ...
MAS-support:* We need a constant!
MAS-support:* What we're setting up here is:
MAS-support:* if macd[today] > macd[yesterday] then
MAS-support:* 1
MAS-support:* else
MAS-support:* 0
MAS-support:* end
MAS-support:* make sense?
Customer:* yes
MAS-support:* So you need to choose a constant.
MAS-support:* (which has been renamed to NUMERIC_VALUE_COMMAND 0
MAS-support:* better name, because it can also function as a
variable - used a lot in the parabolic SAR)
MAS-support:* Let me know when you've got the NUMERIC_VALUE_COMMAND.
Customer:* got that which value do I enter first 1 or 0 ??
MAS-support:* OK, this is the true command - so 1 (it could be
0, but 1 is the protocol we've decided on.)
MAS-support:* So 1.
MAS-support:* Then for the false command, 0!
Customer:* OK we have an indicator - beter save it
MAS-support:* OK!
MAS-support:* I was following along in my own macl session - saved it, too.
MAS-support:* Now, we need to test it.
MAS-support:* Ready to try a test? If it works, we can go on to the analyzer.
Customer:* yes not quite sure how to test an indicator ???
MAS-support:* The easiest way is to use macl.
MAS-support:* If you exited macl, start it up again.
MAS-support:* Let me know when you've got macl ready to go.
Customer:* ok
MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* Are you at the main menu? (select tradable ...)
Customer:* ok
MAS-support:* OK, select a tradable - just so you know which one
you're working with. with s
MAS-support:* After you select a tradable, choose "view data" - v
MAS-support:* Let me know when you're there.
Customer:* selected one and am at select action
MAS-support:* Select action for ?
MAS-support:* If so, do i
MAS-support:* for view indicator.
Customer:* ok print indicator - has lots of 0s ansd 1s - great stuff !!!

MAS-support:* Yep, just what we wanted.
MAS-support:* We can be primitive for now - can you just copy
some of that data with your mouse?
Customer:* thats really neat - the indicators are
complex to build - but having the file lets you retrace your steps and
try again. I was sort of hunting around in the dark saying "Have I tried
this yet ?? "
MAS-support:* We want to save the last screenfull to a file.
MAS-support:* (Yes, it helps to use the -r options.)
MAS-support:* (And of course, you can use the -i option later to
recreate the indicator using that
MAS-support:* file as input.)
...

MAS-support:* try macl again and we'll check with it.
MAS-support:* view the macd indicator
MAS-support:* (Yeah - it's rather a mess - usability issues.)
MAS-support:* Let me know when you've got macl ready.
Customer:* yes the turnarounds seem to be happening ok
Customer:* macl is up
MAS-support:* OK.
MAS-support:* Can you view the data with the macd hist indicator?

MAS-support:* OK.
...

Customer:* my problem was i was unsure about the
indicator building and getting myself confused - this has been a really
good learning experience !!!
MAS-support:* Good - I'm glad it helped.
MAS-support:* I know the interface is hard to understand - you
sort of have to turn yourself into
MAS-support:* a lisp machine!
...

Customer:* yes i think im ok at building an indicator
into an analyser - the problem was truyying to get the comparison
between yesterdays and todays value. I kept running into brick walls
with that bit. The logfile should be a good reference for the future (
dont forget to save it ).
MAS-support:* Yes.
