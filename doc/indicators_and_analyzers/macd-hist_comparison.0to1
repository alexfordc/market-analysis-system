# macl script that defines a market analyzer that detects when an
# indicator (which is 1 if macd-hist[today] > macd-hist[yesterday] and 0
# otherwise) changes from 0 to 1.  It does this by detecting if the
# indicator crosses over a horizontal line whose y value is 0.5, which
# is in between 0 and 1.
