I would like to thank the following people, who directly or indirectly
contributed to MAS:

Leigh Brookshaw - whose GPL Java 2D graph package I used and modified in
the MA GUI Client.

Bob Vanzant - who allowed me to use his Linux server over the internet
for testing MAS.

Paula Decker - who suggested I use the GridBagLayout class to allow the
GUI graph components to be resized the way I wanted and provided other
helpful suggestions for improvements to the GUI.

Ravinder Bahra - who provided feedback on MAS and its documentation.

Eirik Mangseth - who did the original port of MAS to Windows, wrote some
of the code in the database layer, and sent me many helpful suggestions
and bug reports.

Bertrand Meyer - whose superb Eiffel language and development guidelines
helped me to implement MAS with a good design and with minimal bugs.

Paul Crismer - whose excellent ECLI library allowed me to add database
capability on Linux.

Jordan Russell - whose marvelous Inno Setup (
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) package made it possible to
package MAS into a self-installing setup.exe file, making installation on
Windows systems much easier than before.

Berend de Boer - whose magnificent e-POSIX package is used in the MCT
program and is likely to be used in other MAS components in the future.
