The Market Analysis System (MAS) is a software application that
provides tools for analysis of financial markets using technical
analysis, with the goal of helping its user make better buying and
selling decisions and to help save time by automating some tasks that
would otherwise be done by hand.  MAS includes facilities for charting,
as well as for automated batch processing of market data.

MAS is released as free software.

MAS has two main components:  the Market Analysis System Server (also
known as Market Analysis Server) and the Market Analysis GUI Client.
The server provides the capability to apply technical analysis[1]
indicators to market data.  Additionally, the server allows the user
to specify a set of criteria (using one more more technical indicators)
and apply those criteria to market data, generating buy and sell signals
for tradables that meet the criteria.[2]

The current version of the MAS server runs on Linux/Intel and Windows
systems.  The GUI Client is written in Java and should run on any system
with a Java runtime environment (JRE).

The Market Analysis GUI Client (MAGC) provides basic charting facilities,
using the server to obtain market and indicator data.  MAGC currently
displays price data using either standard bar charts or candle charts.

Below is a summary of MAS's features.

Market Analysis Server (MAS)

Functionality:

  - Includes several system-defined technical indicators.
  - Allows the user to create and save new technical indicators.
  - Handles stock splits.
  - Production of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly data from daily data.
  - Production of 10-, 15-, 20-, 30-minute, and hourly data from 5-minute
    data and the same set plus 2-minute data from 1-minute data.
  - Allows user to create and save sets of market-analysis rules.
  - Analyzes market data using selected market-analysis rules.
  - Notification by email of buy and sell signals generated by market analysis.
  - Allows user to add registrants for email of market analysis results.
  - Provides services to GUI or command-line clients using a socket-based
    protocol.
  - One server process can service several GUI clients.
  - Allows market data to be input from files, from the web, or from a
    database.

Provides choice of candles or price bars.
Provides selection of tradables.
Provides choice of all period types available from the server (daily,
   weekly, monthly, etc.)
Displays reference dates and values based on current data.
Allows user to run several windows at a time.
Provides configuration of colors for graph components.
Provides configuration of date range for data.

[1] For those not familiar with technical analysis, it is a set of
techniques for analyzing market data, using indicators such as trend
lines, moving averages, price momentum, oscillators, etc. to identify
changes in market trends.  It is based on the observation that "prices
move in trends which are determined by the changing attitudes of investors
toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological
forces." ["Technical Analysis Explained," by Martin J. Pring]

[2] For example, one configuration I have used is to issue a buy signal
if Stochastic %D crosses below 35% (indicating that the stock is becoming
oversold) and, no more than 28 days before that, the weekly MACD difference
line crossed above the weekly MACD signal line (indicating that the stock
may be in a long-term uptrend), as well as to issue a sell signal for the
opposite event - Stochastic %D crosses above 65% and weekly MACD difference
line crosses below weekly MACD signal line.
