Notes for the Linux version:

After installing MAS, you will probably want to include the location of
the MAS executable in your path.  For example, if your login shell is
bash and MAS was installed in /opt/mas, adding the line:

PATH=$PATH:/opt/mas/bin

to $HOME/.bash_profile will add the mas executable location, /opt/mas/bin,
to your path.

For those who install MAS as root it is recommended that you set
the MAS_DIRECTORY environment variable to a directory under your
home directory and copy the files under the MAS lib directory (e.g.,
/opt/mas/lib, if MAS was installed in /opt/mas) to $MAS_DIRECTORY.
This will allow you to modify the .ma_clientrc and other configuration
files to fit your needs, as well as to run MAS with the web (-w) option,
which needs to create a directory in which to put the data files.

Below is an example for setting MAS_DIRECTORY and other MAS variables for
bash and other Bourne-derivative shells.  If you like, you can copy the
lines below into your shell startup file (e.g., .profile or .bash_profile)
and then modify them to the settings you need on your system so that these
environment variables will be set automatically when you log in.

# Environment variables for MAS
export MAS_MAILER=mutt
export MAS_DIRECTORY=~/.mas
export MAS_STOCK_SPLIT_FILE=NOT_USED
export MAS_MAILER_SUBJECT_FLAG=-s
if [ -z "$PYTHONPATH" ]; then
	export PYTHONPATH=$MAS_DIRECTORY/python
else
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$MAS_DIRECTORY/python
fi

Below is a bash shell script that copies the MAS lib files into your own
directory.  You can either use it as an example or you can copy it into
a file and use it as is, running it as a script.  It should work as is
as long as you've set the MAS_DIRECTORY environment variable correctly.
(For example, if you put the contents below into /tmp/mas_config, you
can run it by typing the following at the command line:

bash /tmp/mas_config

.)  If you use this script, make sure that "#!/bin/bash" is on the first
line.

#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -e $MAS_DIRECTORY ]; then
	mkdir $MAS_DIRECTORY
elif [ ! -d $MAS_DIRECTORY ]; then
	echo "Error: $MAS_DIRECTORY exists and is not a directory" >&2
	exit 1
fi
cd $MAS_DIRECTORY
cp /opt/mas/lib/indicators_persist .
cp /opt/mas/lib/generators_persist .
cp /opt/mas/lib/.ma_clientrc .
cp /opt/mas/lib/mas_dbrc .
cp /opt/mas/lib/mas_httprc .
cp /opt/mas/lib/symbols .
for f in /opt/mas/lib/*; do if [ -d $f ]; then ln -s $f . ; fi; done


Finally, if you wish to try MAS out using the new feature to obtain data
from yahoo.com, you should be able to do so by typing the following at
the command line, provided that you have put the location of the MAS
executables in your path and set MAS_DIRECTORY as explained above:

mas -o -f , -w -b 13579 &
magc 13579 &
