BNF Grammar for shared protocol components


Client-request components:

date_time_range   -> start_date_time [ ";" end_date_time ]
start_date_time   -> date_time_spec | <null>
end_date_time     -> date_time_spec
date_time_spec    -> date_with_sep [ "," time_with_sep ]
time_with_sep     -> hour ":" minute ":" second
date_with_sep     -> year "/" month "/" day


Server-response components:

datetime          -> date [ dfs time ]
mkt_tuple         -> datetime dfs mkt_fields


Regarding the 'date_time_range' construct:

If the optional 'end_date_time' parameter is not included, the server
uses the current date and time ("now") as the ending date-time.  If the
'start_date_time' parameter is empty (<null>):

   - If there is no start-date setting on the server side, the date-time of
     the earliest record of the requested data-set is used.

   - If there is a start-date setting on the server side for the requested
     data set, that start date is used.  (See the protocol-grammar file
     for the specific application components for more information on the
     specification and properties of the start-date setting.)

NOTE:

According to the 'date_time_spec', the 'time_with_sep' component of a
date-time is optional.
