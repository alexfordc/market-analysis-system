Client-Request Definitions:

time_delimited_mkt_data_req: Same as a 'mkt_data_req' except with an
                    additional parameter: The date-time range into which
                    the returned data is expected to fall

time_delimited_ind_data_req: Same as a 'ind_data_req' except with an
                    additional parameter: The date-time range into which
                    the returned data is expected to fall

Expected Responses for (successfully executed) Client-Requests:

time_delimited_mkt_data_req:    mkt_data
time_delimited_ind_data_req:    ind_data


Notes:

For the 'date_time_range' component of 'time_delimited_mkt_data_req' and
'time_delimited_ind_data_req', if the optional 'end_date_time' parameter
is not included, the server uses the current date and time ("now") as the
ending date-time.  If the 'start_date_time' parameter is empty (<null>),
the start date setting for the specified period type (trad_per_type) is
used as the starting date, with 00:00 (midnight) as the time.
