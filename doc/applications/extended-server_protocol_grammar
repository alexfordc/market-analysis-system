time_delimited_mkt_data_req ->
         mkt_symbol "\t" trad_per_type "\t" date_time_range
time_delimited_ind_data_req ->
         indID "\t" mkt_symbol "\t" trad_per_type "\t" date_time_range

Client-Request Definitions:

time_delimited_mkt_data_req: Same as a 'mkt_data_req' except with an
                    additional parameter: The date-time range into which
                    the returned data is expected to fall

time_delimited_ind_data_req: Same as a 'ind_data_req' except with an
                    additional parameter: The date-time range into which
                    the returned data is expected to fall

Expected Responses for (successfully executed) Client-Requests:

time_delimited_mkt_data_req:    mkt_data
time_delimited_ind_data_req:    ind_data


Notes:

See shared_protocol_grammar for the definition of date_time_range,
with the following addendum with respect to the case where the
'start_date_time' parameter is empty (<null>) and there is a "start-date
setting on the server side for the requested data set":

   The start date setting for the specified period type (trad_per_type) is
   used as the starting date, with 00:00 (midnight) as the time.
