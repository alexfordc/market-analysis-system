                       Applications Using TAL


Currently, the only application written for TAL is a test application,
which resides in the directory main_test_app under the main source
directory.

The factories cluster contains the following classes:

    - FACTORY_BUILDER, which builds the other factories used in the
      application.

    - FUNCTION_BUILDER, which builds the different technical indicators
      (such as Moving Average and Momentum) used in the application.

    - TRADABLE_FACTORY, which builds an instance of a descendant of
      TRADABLE, such as STOCK, and loads its market tuple list from an
      input file.

    - STOCK_FACTORY, a descendant of TRADABLE_FACTORY that instantiates a
      STOCK.

FUNCTION_BUILDER creates a hard-coded set of technical indicators
for testing purposes.  In the future, the mechanism for building
technical indicators will be extended to allow new indicators to be
added at run-time.  This facility will probably be placed in the TAL
itself rather than in an application.

The root cluster contains the root class, FINANCE_ROOT, and
TEST_USER_INTERFACE, which provides the command-line user interface
functionality.

The utility cluster contains classes EVENT_REGISTRATION, providing
functionality for registration for events and HELP, a simple class
providing help instructions used by the user interface.
