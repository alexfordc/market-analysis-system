# List of test input/output-reference files for test 2
# Format:

# (epsilon is optional).
# This tests the colby data for rsi (n = 4) and the user-build EMA function
# instead of the hard-coded one.  Note: With the current version of the
# test script, the n-value for RSI must be reset (and stored) by hand to 4.
# If the RSI test fails, this is one of the first items to check.  (And if
# the test fails with test_files.1, the RSI n-value may not have been
# reset back to 7.)
