The files ema, macd, macd_hist, and macd_sig contain output from TA
functions written in C++ to be used in testing - for comparison with
output from the Eiffel version.  The file test_data.one_field (which
contains one-field-per-record data extracted (closing prices) from the
file ../input/test_data) was used for input.

The files ma, momentum, roc, slow_stochD3, stochD5, stochK5, rsi7, and
williams contain data from examples in two books (ma from "Technical
Analysis Explained", by Martin Pring and the rest from "Trading for a
Living", by Alexander Elder) showing how to calculate these indicators.
The file ../input/stoch contains the input test data corresponding to
slow_stochD3, stochD5, and stochK5.  Corresponding input data for the
files ma, momentum, roc, rsi7, and williams, are in files with the same names
under ../input (minus the 7 for the rsi file).

Note:  The RSI reference values in rsi7 were calculated using the awk script
../lib/rsi.awk.  They are less rounded versions of the values listed in
"Trading for a Living", page 163.
