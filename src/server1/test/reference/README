The files ema, macd, macd_hist, and macd_sig contain output from TA
functions written in C++ to be used in testing - for comparison with
output from the Eiffel version.  The file test_data.one_field (which
contains one-field-per-record data extracted (closing prices) from the
file ../input/test_data) was used for input.

The files ma, momentum, roc, slow_stochD3, stochD5, stochK5, rsi7, and
williams contain data from examples in two books (ma from "Technical
Analysis Explained", by Martin Pring and the rest from "Trading for a
Living", by Alexander Elder) showing how to calculate these indicators.
The file ../input/stoch contains the input test data corresponding to
slow_stochD3, stochD5, and stochK5.  Corresponding input data for the
files ma, momentum, roc, rsi7, and williams, are in files with the same names
under ../input (minus the 7 for the rsi file).

Note:  The RSI data in the example in Elder's book appears to have been
calculated with a slightly different formula than is written in the book.
Until I figure out the formula most commonly used, the data in the
current rsi7 file, which was constructured with the rsi.awk script and is
different from the values in Elder's book, will remain as the reference.
