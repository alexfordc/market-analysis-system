If you wish to compile MAS, the following environment variables need to be
set properly to allow the Eiffel compiler to locate the needed source files:

MAS           base directory for MAS files (parent of "src/" directory)
EIFFEL4       ISE Eiffel 4 directory
ECLI          base directory for Paul Crismer's ECLI/ODBC library
GOBO          base directory for Eric Bezault's Gobo Eiffel libraries

See the file environment for required settings for running MAS.
