If you wish to compile MAS, the following environment variables need to be
set properly to allow the Eiffel compiler to locate the needed source files:

MAS                         base directory for MAS files
EIFFEL4                     ISE Eiffel 4 directory

See the file env_settings for required settings for running MAS.
