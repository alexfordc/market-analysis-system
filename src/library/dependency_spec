# Specification for cluster dependency checking with "check_dep"
# Structure: "directory<Tab>rank"
#    Where rank is an integer > 0 - The lower the number, the higher the
#    abstraction level of the associated cluster.  (Clusters of a
#    particular abstraction level should not depend on clusters of a lower
#    abstraction level - that is, a cluster with rank n should not depend
#    on a cluster with rank n + x, where x > 0.)
