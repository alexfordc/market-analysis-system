To automatically install and configure the MAS server and web application,
first edit the configuration file, mas-deploy.cf, as needed and then
run the deploy_mas script:

./deploy_mas

After installation:

To start the MAS server, run the start_mas_server script.
To stop the MAS server, run the shutdown_mas_server script.

These scripts reside in mas/bin, within the directory specified as the
mas_deployment_dir in the mas-deploy.cf file.
