Experimental files

For example, here's an explanatory note in the web test directory about
index.html.new and jsptest.jsp:

It looks like the files:

index.html.new
jsptest.jsp

constitute the beginning of an experiment to implement a more full-fledged
JSP-based application - i.e., I was playing around with ideas for using JSP
to add more functionality.  I also appears that did not get very far with
the experiment.

I'm leaving the files here for now to allow me to continue the experiment
later, if I decide to.
