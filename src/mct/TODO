Need to deal with MAS_DIRECTORY configuration.

For the mctrc file, add a construct for defining a "user-defined" variable -
similar to <data_dir> and <bin_dir>, but user-defined, which can then be
used in definitions that follow.  With this convention, <data_dir>, etc.
may not be needed.  Example with possible format:

define	mas_bin_dir:/usr/local/bin
define	macl_dir:/opt/mas/bin
define	data_file_dir:/opt/mas/bin

# Detailed version of command to start the server: data from files
begin	start_server_command
command	<mas_bin_dir>/mas -o -f , -b <portnumber> <data_file_dir>/*.txt
command_description	Get data from files
command_name	File-based
end

start_cl_client_command	xterm -e <macl_dir>/macl -h <hostname> <portnumber>

[End of example]
