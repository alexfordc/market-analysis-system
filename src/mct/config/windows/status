This mctrc file is tuned for windows 98.  The "browse_*command" settings
work.  The "start_cl_client_command" command behaves like it should work, but
doesn't: It starts up a DOS window, but the macl/mas menu never appears -
it just hangs.  The "chart_command" has not yet been worked with.  (i.e.,
it currently doesn't work.)
