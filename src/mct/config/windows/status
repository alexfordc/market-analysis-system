The mctrc.win98 file is tuned for windows 98.  The only way I could find to
get the macl and charting commands to work is by calling a separate
batch file, run_command.bat.

mctrc.nt is the current version of the NT mctrc.

mctrc.nt has been tested on NT and works.  Some changes were made to
mctrc.win98 since it was tested on the latptop, so it should be tested
again.

These files have not yet been incorporated into the config_tool template ...
scheme.  (The win98 vs. NT differences probably need to be incorporated
into the bash_init script.)  When they are incorporated, the final results
need to be tested before release, of course.
