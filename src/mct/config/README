Configuration files are stored here.

Note: ctcmd is a script that produces linux and windows versions of the
mctrc file by using the mctrc-spec.linux and mctrc-spec.windows files
as spec files for the config_tool to produce linux (mctrc.linux) and
windows (mctrc.windows) mctrc files from the template file mctrc.template.
This allows settings common to linux and windows to be stored in one file
(mctrc.template).
