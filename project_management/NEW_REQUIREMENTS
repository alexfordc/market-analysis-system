Input Data Validation

[Requested by Stockpoint (email dialog with Eirik Mangseth):
Fri Aug 18 2000; revised Mon Aug 28]

The validation of input data in MAS will be extended to include the following:

1. All errors, including input data errors, will be reported on the standard
error stream.  We can add more sophisticated error logging later, if we
decide it's needed.  (Note that this involves a change, since errors are
currently reported on standard output, rather than standard error.  I think
this change makes sense, but if you think of reasons not to do it (perhaps
it won't work well on Windows?), let me know.)

2. For a particular record, if the constraint "low <= close <= high and
low <= open <= high" does not hold and the offending field is greater than
0, the field values will be changed with the following algorithm so that
the constraint does hold:

    if low > close then low := close end
    if high < close then high := close end
    if open_available then
        if low > open then low := open end
        if high < open then high := open end
    end

3.  If the volume field of a record has a value less than 0, it will be
changed to 0.

4.  If any of the following errors occur within a record, the record will
be discarded and processing will continue:

   - An empty field is found (two field separators with nothing in between).

   - The record has too many or two few field separators.

   - Characters other than [0-9] occur in the date, volume, or open interest
     fields.

   - A field of real type (open, high, low, and close [and, if
     added, and any other real type]) contains something other
     than the characters [0-9] with an optional '.'.  [I came across your
     email that mentioned the European notation that uses ',', but I'm
     assuming that for market data '.' is standard and ',' will never be
     encountered.  If you think this is incorrect, let me know and MAS can
     be changed to allow ','.]

   - The open, high, low, or close field has a value less than or equal to 0.

   - The date field has less than 5 digits.

   - The value of the date field is earlier than that of the previous record.

5. There will be two error checking modes, a normal error checking mode, with
the behavior described in 1 - 4, and a strict error checking mode, where the
behavior described in 1 - 4 will be the same except that any record for
which an error is encountered will be unconditionally discarded.
