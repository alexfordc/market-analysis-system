In here go old cvs-ified files that are either old and possibly obsolete,
but may be reinstated, or cvs-ified files kept here for the purpose of
keeping the cvs history of a file where keeping a file with its original
cvs history in its proper place is not convenient, such as in the situation
caused by my error when I asked the sourceforge cvs administrator to move
some files into subdirectories of
/home/development/jtc/finance/src/eiffel_library (the sym-linked directory)
instead of /home/development/jtc/eiffel_library.  In this case I just
created new cvs versions of the current files in order to not have to
wait for the cvs sysadmin to fix my error.  The files put in the
/home/development/jtc/finance/src/eiffel_library directory, which contain
original cvs history, are to go in here.
